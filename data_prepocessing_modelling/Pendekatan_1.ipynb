This is particularly germane, as the conceptualization and measurement of narcissism have evolved in recent years. This is observed in the development of spectrum and/or dimensional models of narcissism, concomitant with the conceptual developments of vanity that have emerged since its original inclusion in the Narcissism Personality Inventory. Specifically, our research question evaluated whether vanity remains as traditionally construed, i.e., as a facet of narcissism, or is better conceptualized as a distinct construct separated from the earlier models of narcissism and therefore provide novel implications in understanding personality and social behavior. Based on the traits of pride, empathy, and several social behavior variables, it was hypothesized that a differentiation between narcissism and vanity would be observed. The participants were 441 undergraduate students from a large public midwestern university who participated in a self-report online survey. Correlation and regression analyses were conducted. The results revealed that the characterization of vanity is limited to pride and an absence of empathy and social behavior. Findings reaffirm behavior patterns of grandiose and vulnerable narcissism regarding selflessness, image management, and sensitivity to others. The core motivations of vanity are explicated as based on social comparison theory to assess one\\u2019s subjective and/or objective value though it is not characterized as a \\u201csocial\\u201d trait or by social behavior, in contrast to how narcissism is characterized. Based on our findings and an improved understanding of the narcissism model, we conclude that vanity is more closely related to the grandiose dimension of narcissism and discuss how the underlying motivations of vanity improve our understanding of grandiose narcissism. We discuss the implications that these findings provide to the developing, modern conceptualizations of narcissism and affirm and expand our understanding of vanity in personality.\",\n          \"Abstract Existing research suggests that there is an overlap between binge eating disorder  and the construct of \\u2018food addiction\\u2019 . The objective of this study was to determine the overlapping features of BED and FA through a comparison of the individual scales of commonly used tools including the Binge Eating Scale  and the Yale Food Addiction Scale  in a sample of Australian adults. Adults  were invited to complete an anonymous online survey on FA. Binge eating was assessed through the BES and addictive eating behaviours were assessed through the YFAS . The prevalence and severity of both FA and binge eating increased across weight categories. The overall correlation between the total score from the BES and FA symptoms wasr= 0.76,p< 0.001; for females it wasr= 0.77,p< 0.001, and for males it wasr= 0.65,p< 0.001. Total BES score and the BES emotion factor were most often associated with FA symptoms, as was demonstrated to produce stronger correlations with FA symptoms. In contrast, the BES behaviour factor was less strongly associated to FA with the majority of correlations <0.6. This study demonstrates the overlap between BED and FA, and highlights the possible unique differences between the forms of disordered eating.\",\n          \"Abstract General well-being is a positive evaluation of one\\u2019s mental health, which is an important topic in mental health. General well-being is fundamental to the positive development of young people. A thorough understanding of the factors that influence happiness have not yet been developed for students at normal universities in Ningxia Province in China. This study examined the mediation effects of time management on the relationship between achievement motivation, self-efficacy, and general well-being among students at normal universities in Ningxia Province in China. Using a random sampling, 163 participants  completed the Achievement Motivation Scale , General Self-efficacy Scale , Time Management Questionnaire  and General Well-being Scale . Achievement motivation, self-efficacy, and time management were positively correlated with general well-being. The mediation effects of time management on the relationships between achievement motivation, self-efficacy, and general wellbeing  were demonstrated. These results add to the nuanced relationship between self-efficacy, achievement motivation, and general well-being. According to the Achievement Motivation Theory and the Self-efficacy Theory, this study reveals the role of achievement motivation, self-efficacy on general well-being and the mediating effect of time management in the relationship between achievement motivation, self-efficacy, and general well-being.

NarcissismThe word \\u201cnarcissism\\u201d originates from the Greek myth of Narcissus. In the story, Narcissus rejects Echo, the nymph, and the gods punish him by causing him to fall in love with his reflection . Thus, the depiction of the self-absorption and egotism of Narcissus prompted the term \\u201cnarcissism\\u201d that we now use to assess and describe personality composition or pathology. Narcissism is a multi-faceted and relatively stable personality construct traditionally characterized by self-entitlement, self-importance, and excessive preoccupation with one\\u2019s own needs at the expense of others . While narcissism is commonly perceived as a pathology, it can be found in healthy individuals at much lower levels than in individuals with narcissistic personality disorder .In early personality research, narcissism was defined using a single factor model. The current literature conceptualizes narcissism as a spectrum model consisting of the dimensions of grandiose and vulnerable narcissism anchored by a middle-ground dimension of self-entitlement/antagonism that both grandiose and vulnerable narcissism appear to share . In addition, a tri-facet model has recently proposed the agentic , antagonistic , and neurotic  facets of narcissism, which mirror the spectrum in Krizan and Herlache\\u2019s  model . Grandiose narcissism refers to the behaviors and feelings of exhibitionism, arrogance, and overconfidence . Vulnerable narcissism refers to behaviors and feelings of defensiveness and hypersensitivity to criticism, withdrawal, avoidant behaviors, and sensitive attitudes . While both dimensions of narcissism are characterized by self-absorption/self-importance/self-entitlement , with a need for the conservation of the ego, recent research has shown that these trait measures are distinct and have revealed distinctive features of both dimensions of narcissism in interpersonal and social situations. Examples of how the dimensions differ include self-esteem levels, threat perception, external and internal concerns, attachment style, altruistic/prosocial behavior, well-being and, within the Big 5-factor personality assessment, a specific focus on the factors of neuroticism, openness, and extraversion . As the narcissism spectrum model   continues to gain support, we anticipate further expansion of the conceptual model regarding linearity/non-linearity of the dimensions and determining characteristics and behaviors that distinguish the dimensions.1.2. VanityVanity originates from the Latin word vanus or vanitas, which describes something as \\u201cempty\\u201d or \\u201cmeaningless\\u201d . A similar term, vanite, found in the old French literature, translates into futility and self-conceit . Both Latin and French contributed to our understanding of vanity. In English, the term embodies excessive self-concern and the idea that this concern or expectation may be subjective or meaningless to others beyond the self. As we use it, vanity is a concern for a positive view of one\\u2019s appearance and/or achievement; vanity has commonly been considered synonymous with excessive pride . The conceptual and evolutionary foundations of vanity are set out in the social comparison theory developed by Festinger : individuals determine their personal and social self-worth based on how they perceive themselves in contrast to others. People compare themselves to others within their social reference groups as they experience pressure toward uniformity within the reference group . Individuals are motivated to make social comparisons to pursue self-evaluations for self-improvement and self-enhancement to boost self-esteem and self-concept . Social comparison theory thus enables researchers to focus on the manifestations of self-concern, such as physical appearance and personal achievements. However, these are commonly subjective to an individual\\u2019s values and are volatile to external factors.The first notable measure of vanity in personality appeared as a facet in the 40-item Narcissism Personality Inventory  . However, this subscale contains only three items to assess vanity and only provides a limited evaluation of appearance vanity values . Outside this sub-measure, there is a paucity of research on vanity in personality and behavioral psychology. Vanity is predominantly studied within consumerism, where social comparison theory applies to advertising methods and exposure . Vanity is notably measured via two subtypes, appearance vanity and achievement vanity, which reflect the distinct types of personal goals of an individual along with perceptions of their appearance or achievements . Specifically, we observe that an external predictor focuses on vanity and economic behavior and has limited consideration of the core motivations and underlying mechanisms of vanity in personality. A recent study suggested that individuals who self-report higher levels of vanity report higher levels of willingness to endure more external social costs and internal personal costs to achieve the public image they wish to attain. This highlights an important need to expand the personality literature to better understand the affective core of vanity and its patterns or relationships with social behavior in other personal areas of life .1.3. Empathy, Narcissism, and VanityHogan  described empathy as \\u2018\\u2018the intellectual or imaginative apprehension of another\\u2019s condition or state of mind\\u201d, and, to the extent that it correlates with prosocial behavior, empathy is a core motivation of altruistic behavior . Typically, narcissism prompts individuals to engage in public or communal acts of service to boost their self-valuation and affirm their grandiose perceptions about themselves, rather than stemming from empathetic values or altruism . Narcissism has been characterized in research findings as self-centeredness and disregard toward others, which implies a lack of empathy or a deficit in individuals with high levels of narcissism . Other factors may also co-occur  that suppress empathic ability or result in a dysfunctional form of empathy that may register empathy as non-existent in the individual . Higher levels of narcissism and impaired or empathy deficits may lead to relationship dysfunction, impaired social abilities, and an exaggerated self-concept within narcissistic individuals. However, the relationship between vanity  and empathy has not been well-studied. There is a gap in the existing literature regarding studies of vanity and the relationship that empathy may have with the more recent work positing the two types of vanity. This study examines the relationship between vanity and empathy.1.4. Pride, Narcissism, and VanityTracy and Robins  sought to broaden the understanding of pride in personality by outlining two types: authentic and hubristic. These are distinguished by the controllable, specific, or uncontrollable and global attributions that the type of pride reflects . Authentic pride is based on something the individual did , bringing the individual a sense of accomplishment and pride. In contrast, hubristic pride arises from an individual\\u2019s concept of self , derived simply from being and not based on specific actions . Pride can be associated with both prosocial  and antisocial  behaviors . Hubristic pride and elevated levels of narcissism tend to lead to similar dysfunctional social outcomes, as each is positively associated with adverse relational outcomes, antisocial behaviors and perceptions of others, and aggression . Alternatively, authentic pride and genuine self-esteem have positive associations with successful relationships, prosocial outcomes and perceptions, and positive mental health outcomes . Unfortunately, there is a paucity of research on vanity and its associations with pride, as the literature has restricted each to their implied synonymy. Our study seeks to fill this gap in the literature regarding vanity  and its relationship with pride .1.5. Social Behaviors of Interest Regarding Narcissism and Vanity: Sensitivity to Others, Communal Image Management, and Selflessness\\u201cSensitivity to Others\\u201d is a concept rooted in sociality and tied to self-autonomy . This social concept mirrors how reactive or \\u201csensitive\\u201d one is to the thoughts, feelings, intimacy, and needs of others . Sensitivity to others consists of cognitive and behavioral processes about how quick one is to react in providing a need or support to another person and, thus, sustaining their own personal and social need for relationships. Conceptually, sensitivity to others provides the awareness and inclination under which social connectedness and bondedness may occur . Accordingly, sensitivity to others was assessed as a criterion variable to determine whether vanity and narcissism differed in self-reports of social sensitivity and reactivity.Communal image management is the management of one\\u2019s self-presentation to reflect community morale and pleasantry . It consists of qualities of self-presentation that help with \\u201cgetting along\\u201d within a community to which one belongs . We chose communal image management to determine whether vanity and narcissism differ in their associations with one\\u2019s efforts at self-presentation or promote communal morale for the sake of one\\u2019s identity and, importantly, whether based on an actual audience or an \\u201cinternalized\\u201d audience .Selflessness is the ability to push aside needs and interests to fulfill or serve the interests of others . Selflessness has been studied in research focused on social likeability, relational satisfaction, and so on . We chose selflessness to determine whether vanity and narcissism differed in their associations with the inclination or ability to be selfless.1.6. Purpose, Study Outline, and HypothesesNarcissism and vanity are presumed to resemble one another in terms of connotations and usage in communication, and both incorporate self-centered qualities and concerns. Narcissism  is also characterized by a lack of concern for others and a sense of entitlement , whereas vanity is less well specified in comparison in personality literature, although it has been characterized as a drive to increase or highlight one\\u2019s value of self with an additional emphasis on concern about one\\u2019s public image . The single-factor narcissism model traditionally conceptualizes having \\u2018vanity\\u2019 as a facet of narcissism . This is observed in the widely used Narcissism Personality Inventory , which measures vanity using a three-item assessment. The recent reevaluation of narcissism as a dimensional or spectrum model  prompted us to reconsider the validity of vanity as a facet of the newer conceptual model of narcissism, as trait measures of grandiose and vulnerable narcissism are distinct . A recent study found that while single-factor narcissism revealed a strong relationship with the NPI vanity facet, grandiose narcissism revealed a small relationship with NPI vanity and vulnerable narcissism revealed a non-significant relationship with NPI vanity . In addition, a more comprehensive vanity scale  has been established since the introduction of the NPI and warrants the examination of narcissism using a potentially better measure of vanity. Modern developments in both the literature and refinement of methodologies that examine both vanity and narcissism challenge the traditional and more outdated understanding of how the two interrelate. This raises the question we want to explore in this paper: would a more comprehensive measure of vanity reveal associations with both or one of the dimensions of narcissism and therefore remain a facet of the new narcissism model, or may it be the case that vanity is distinct from the dimensions of narcissism as outlined by more recent work? As the topic of narcissism in the psychological community has increased in popularity and contributes value to understanding the self, this calls for a need to further expand the narcissism model and its relationship to other personality constructs and behaviors . It makes sense to reexamine vanity\\u2019s relationship to narcissism as we reassess what is contributing to the characteristic foundation of the dimensions of narcissism. Therefore, we seek to challenge and examine how vanity and narcissism overlap or may not overlap based on current conceptions of the two. Unraveling a potential new relationship between vanity and narcissism will reveal implications related to how we understand the \\u201cmotivational dynamics\\u201d of both narcissism and vanity . Given that these core motivations influence social behavior, we suspect that reevaluating the recent conceptualizations of vanity and narcissism will reveal novel implications associated with the traits and how they influence social behavior.We examined how narcissism and vanity may interact as a function of how each construct relates to other social characteristics to determine whether vanity and narcissism are differentiated. For the selection of the social behaviors to study, we selected social outcomes that are commonly associated as being influenced by narcissism or have been commonly studied relative to personality and the concern with self. These include pride , empathy, sensitivity to others, image management, and selflessness. Our study aims to determine where vanity may reside in personality relative to narcissism and expand on vanity in personality psychology, where a gap in the literature is present.We hypothesized  that narcissism and vanity are distinguishable and independent multidimensional constructs. We hypothesized  that self-reported narcissism and vanity will differ in their associations with social characteristics, such as pride and empathy, and by way of the selected social outcome variables. We hypothesized  that both types of self-reported vanity  will have a negative relationship with empathy and correlate with higher levels of self-reported authentic pride. We hypothesized  that both types of self-reported narcissism will lack a relationship with self-reported empathy and higher levels of self-reported hubristic pride than vanity. However, we also predict that self-reported grandiose narcissism will evidence higher levels of authentic and hubristic pride based on previous literature on single-factor narcissism and pride . Based on the lack of preexisting work on vanity and personality, our study concerning social outcome variables is exploratory. However, we hypothesized  that the dimensions of narcissism will show significant relationship patterns with sensitivity to others, selflessness, and communal image management.\",\n          \"\\u2018Food addiction\\u2019  presents as a contentious construct, which has yet to gain scientific acceptance due to an overall lack of high quality research . There is scientific debate about the appropriateness of terminology, with \\u2018eating addiction\\u2019 previously proposed to be more reflective rather than \\u2018food addiction\\u2019, given the uncertainty of whether addictive eating behaviours more closely align to substance-based addictions, like drug and alcohol addictions, or with behavioural addictions, such as gambling addiction . Addictions to drugs, alcohol, and gambling are formally recognised in the Diagnostic Statistics Manual, version 5  . However, FA is currently not a recognised condition in DSM and instead is characterised through the assessment and endorsement of addiction-like symptoms through self-report tools or surveys. The most commonly used tool is the Yale Food Addiction Scale . Originally developed in 2009 and revised in 2016, the YFAS 2.0 maps to the criteria used to classify substance dependence . The YFAS tool assesses 11 symptoms of addiction, as well the level of distress associated with them, which parallel other addiction symptoms in DSM such as tolerance and craving. In addition, the tool can determine the level of severity of addiction ranging from mild to severe .There has been previous suggestion that FA may be a sub-type of disordered eating, and that the FA construct is an indicator of higher eating disorder severity . Research suggests that FA does show overlap with several disordered eating phenotypes, with the majority of existing research investigating binge eating disorder  and bulimia nervosa rather than other disordered eating categories such as anorexia nervosa .BED is classified by the DSM-5 as the recurrent, periodic, and uncontrolled consumption of large quantities of food without compensatory behaviours  to control weight . It has been estimated that BED affects approximately 2% of the global population , while FA affects approximately 20%, with both conditions found to be more common in females . The prevalence of FA in two existing studies of individuals with diagnosed BED was 41.5% and 56.8% . The prevalence of FA in individuals with a current diagnosis of bulimia nervosa was 83.6% and 100%, and 30% of individuals with a history of bulimia nervosa met the diagnostic criteria for FA . In a more recent study of individuals with clinical BED assessed through an objective clinical interview rather than self-report, those with BED were also identified with FA . Existing research suggests an overlap between these conditions, often through cross-sectional studies, which show that the overlap between BED and FA varies between 0.59 and 0.78) . The overlap between BED and FA however is not 100%, and while binge eating is a key eating disorder feature, the association between FA and disordered eating behaviour is unclear. It is acknowledged that the symptoms of general psychological distress found to be associated with FA are strongly associated with binge eating and other eating disorder symptoms .Similarities in symptomology that exist between FA and BED include the consumption of larger amounts of food than intended, reduced control over eating and continued use despite negative consequences , intense cravings , emotional dysregulation, and increased impulsivity . Due to these similarities, it is not unusual that BED and FA are often highly correlated. A meta-analysis also reported that YFAS symptom scores were positively associated with binge eating behaviours .Existing research has investigated FA specifically in binge eating populations and individuals seeking bariatric surgery, and identified similarities in the specific characteristics of both conditions when assessed by validated surveys . In addition, recent research highlights the associations between patterns of compulsive overeating, including binge eating with \\u2018food addiction\\u2019 . However, these conditions have not been investigated at the scale, factor, or item level of common assessment scales. Instead previous research has explored associations in absolute scores that indicate the overall severity of FA or BED. Investigating factor levels for these constructs may provide important information about where the overlapping features exist and whether there are factors which separate these conditions. Strong correlations would be expected between subscales that may map to the same attribute, and lower correlations between subscales from different attributes. Therefore, the current study aims to determine the overlapping features of BED and FA through a comparison of the individual constructs of the Binge Eating Scale  and YFAS in a sample of Australian adults.\",\n          \"General well-being has been defined as the experience of pleasant emotions like happiness and satisfaction, and the ability to feel good and operate well, the development of personal potential, having some control over life, having goals, and experiencing positive connections . General well-being is a positive evaluation of one\\u2019s mental health, which is an important topic. Individuals with high life satisfaction and high positive emotions may have less depression, loneliness, higher self-esteem, and fewer mental problems .At present, the incidence of psychological problems among college students is frighteningly high, among which depression, anxiety, stress, and other diseases are the most common, accounting for 76%, 88.4%, and 45.5% . These issues can affect the general well-being of college students . When college students enter university, they often feel academic tension, which can also have a certain impact on their general well-being . Among college students, academic stress can increase due to heavy workloads, inadequate faculty support, and an unsupportive campus environment . In addition, academic performance is a major factor in college students\\u2019 employment success. It makes some students feel more stress, resulting in anxiety, depression, and so on . The lack of quality of life may lead to some negative consequences, such as psychological stress, physical discomfort, low mood, social isolation, etc. . The evaluation of college students\\u2019 general well-being has become a key issue in current social and mental health research .Students in normal universities are the key group for the cultivation of educational talents. The term \\u201cnormal university\\u201d is a kind of oxymoron, or contradiction of terms. The term \\u201cnormal\\u201d in English can only be clearly understood with reference to its French roots, where it means \\u201csetting a moral standard or pattern\\u201d . Students from normal Universities in Ningxia will become teachers, educational administrators, and educational researchers in the future. Their educational professional ability will directly affect the development and promotion of education in Ningxia. Ningxia is in the stage of rapid development and transformation, requiring both social stability and sustainable development. University students in normal universities have a professional educational background and knowledge, making them a crucial force in promoting social development in Ningxia .According to the Achievement Motivation Theory and the Self-efficacy Theory, achievement motivation and self-efficacy can influence general well-being . In addition, some studies have showed that time management as well can influence general well-being. Therefore, the current study was aimed to identify the relationship among achievement motivation, self-efficacy, and time management towards general well-being of students at normal universities in Ningxia Province in China.Motivation refers to an innate drive that motivates people to engage in certain activities, and achievement motivation is an important form of motivation. A person\\u2019s success depends on his motivation . In the context of the knowledge economy, motivation is a very important psychological element that occupies a central position among non-intellectual elements and exerts a significant influence on it . Achievement motivation is the self-motivating force created by exceptional people in the survival of the fittest struggle. People are driven to want to engage in tough and meaningful activities, and to be better than others by this motivation .According to the Achievement Motivation Theory, when an individual is able to achieve personal goals, overcome challenges, and achieve success, he will experience a positive emotion, thus improving well-being. Individuals with high achievement motivation are generally more determined and motivated to pursue success, they value their own achievements more, and they have a higher likelihood of experiencing satisfaction and high general well-being .Research shows that there is a strong relationship between people\\u2019s achievement motivation and their level of general well-being. Numerous studies have shown that general well-being and achievement motivation are closely associated, and that high achievement motivation is essential for improving general well-being . People with higher achievement motivation have higher needs for self-realization in their lives. As people progress towards self-realization, they will have a higher sense of well-being overall .The Self-efficacy theory holds that an individuals\\u2019 beliefs and confidence allows them to effectively complete various tasks, namely self-efficacy, and it has an important impact on happiness. Individuals with higher self-efficacy feel they can take on challenges, get through obstacles, and accomplish goals, and are therefore more likely to experience the pleasure of achievement and have high general well-being. Contrarily, individuals with low self-efficacy frequently feel helpless and depressed, and lack confidence in achievement, which affects their general well-being .Research has found that generalized self-efficacy is strongly associated with positive affects  and negative affects . In addition, individual self-efficacy is also a key factor in improving individual general well-being .Time management belongs to a common concept in every management field, and it describes a set of actions used to raise people\\u2019s time utilization rate, so that they can make better use of their time, so as to achieve their own or organizational goals . People with high achievement motivation often have a strong desire for success and have a high enthusiasm for success. In order to achieve success, they need to understand the importance of time, monitor and use time reasonably and efficiently to achieve their goals. On the contrary, individuals with low levels of achievement motivation have insufficient understanding of time value and a low ability of time monitoring. Achievement motivation can predict time management tendency. Lu  and Xin et al.  have proved that the higher the college students\\u2019 achievement motivation, the stronger their time management ability and ability to effectively monitor time .Zhang et al.  and Li et al.  pointed out that general self-efficacy can significantly positively predict time management tendency . Individuals who have a high sense of general self-efficacy are full of confidence in their ability to deal with things, and they can deal with and arrange various problems properly, so they can better plan, arrange, and make use of their time. While time control is a common problem among college students, time control is also a recurring problem that can have an emotional and physical impact on students in rigorous majors . Existing studies have shown that young people experience increased levels of stress and decreased levels of general well-being due to learning, environmental factors, and time-management skills . Some previous independent studies have confirmed the effectiveness of some interventions that aim to increase general well-being in education environments, such as smart devices, and the use of time management aides . Based on the results of previous research, hypotheses 1\\u20135 were proposed.Hypothesis1.There is a positive influence of achievement motivation on general well-being.Hypothesis2.There is a positive influence of self-efficacy on general well-being.Hypothesis3.There is a positive influence of time management on well-being.Hypothesis4.Time management mediates the relationship between achievement motivation and well-being.Hypothesis5.Time management mediates the relationship between self-efficacy and well-being.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Section 2.

The sample consisted of 329 females, 102 males, and 10 participants who did not disclose their gender or self-reported as non-binary. There were no differences by gender on any of the primary predictor variables, and, as a result, we did not perform any analyses by gender. The mean age was 19.0 . The racial/ethnic composition of our sample was reported to be 78.3% white, 8.9% Hispanic or Latino, 5.3% African American or Black, 3.4% Asian or Pacific Islander, 3.1% multi-ethnic, less than 1% reported as American Indian or Alaskan Native, and less than 1% did not report their racial/ethnic identity.2.2. Measures/InstrumentsThe Narcissism Personality Inventory-16  or NPI-16 assesses subclinical narcissism, considering the traditional characteristics of narcissism associated with grandiose narcissism . The NPI-16 consists of 16 paired items, with 0 scoring if a participant chooses the neutral statement and 1 scoring if the grandiose statement is chosen. An example of a grandiose item from this measure states, \\u201cI like to be the center of attention\\u201d, with its counterpart as \\u201cI prefer to blend in with the crowd\\u201d. After reverse scoring the requisite items, NPI-16 scores were obtained by summing the total survey responses of the participants; the score represents the number of grandiose narcissism characteristics self-reported as present. Cronbach\\u2019s alpha for the Narcissism Personality Inventory was reported as 0.85 .The hypersensitive narcissism scale   assesses subclinical narcissism characteristics associated with vulnerable narcissism . The HSNS consists of 10 5-point Likert scale items, with 1 scoring as \\u201cstrongly disagree\\u201d and 5 scoring as \\u201cstrongly agree\\u201d. An example of an item from this measure states, \\u201cI dislike being in a group unless I know that I am appreciated by at least one of those present\\u201d. Scores were obtained by summing the participants\\u2019 survey responses; the score represented the number of vulnerable narcissism characteristics self-reported as present. Cronbach\\u2019s alpha for the hypersensitive narcissism scale has been reported as 0.72 and 0.76 for females and males, respectively, scoring the male data sample from Cheek and Melchior\\u2019s  data .The vanity scale  consists of two subscales of vanity  to assess the trait across four total dimensions: appearance concern, appearance view, achievement concern, and achievement view. The vanity scale consists of 21 7-point Likert-scale items, with 1 scoring as \\u201cstrongly disagree\\u201d and 7 scoring as \\u201cstrongly agree\\u201d. An example of an appearance vanity item from this measure states, \\u201cThe way I look is extremely important to me\\u201d. An example of an achievement vanity item from this measure states, \\u201cI am more concerned with professional/academic success than most people I know\\u201d. Scores were obtained by summing the total of the participants\\u2019 survey responses to the subscales of appearance vanity and achievement vanity, and the scores of each subscale represented the amount of appearance and/or achievement vanity characteristics self-reported as present. Cronbach\\u2019s alpha for the vanity scale has been reported across the four scale dimensions ranging from 0.80 to 0.92 .The pride short-form scale  assesses how closely one may generally feel daily towards descriptive words that describe authentic and/or hubristic pride based on self-reporting. The scale consists of 14 items rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1  to 5 . An example of an authentic pride item from this measure states, \\u201cRate to the extent you generally feel accomplished\\u201d, and an example of a hubristic pride item states, \\u201cRate to the extent you generally feel smug\\u201d. Cronbach\\u2019s alpha for the pride short-form scale has been reported as 0.88 for the authentic pride scale and 0.90 for the hubristic pride scale.The Jackson Personality Inventory: Empathy , or JPI: EMP assessed self-reported levels of empathetic ableness toward others. The full-length JPI consists of 300 true/false items, with 15 subscales of personality domains. We used items from the empathy subscale. An example of an item from the empathy subscale states, \\u201cI feel others\\u2019 emotions\\u201d. Cronbach\\u2019s alpha for the Jackson Personality Inventory: Empathy has been reported as 0.80 .The autonomy\\u2013connectedness scale , or ACS, assesses \\u201cself-awareness, sensitivity to others, and the capacity for managing new situations\\u201d. The ACS consists of 30 items with three subscales to measure the respective attributes. The items were measured on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1  to 5 . We used items from the subscale of \\u201csensitivity to others\\u201d. An example of an item from the sensitivity to others subscale states, \\u201cI can hardly bear it when people are angry with me\\u201d. Cronbach\\u2019s alpha for the autonomy\\u2013connectedness scale has been reported as 0.78 for the subscale of \\u201csensitivity to others\\u201d .The bidimensional image/impression management scale , or IM, assesses the distinction between agency and communal image management of one\\u2019s self-presentation based on self-reports. The IM short form consists of 20 items derived from the SDR  and forms the subscales of agentic management  and communal management  . The items were measured on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1  to 7 . We used the communal image management subscale to assess image management within a social/communal context. An example from the communal image management subscale states, \\u201cI have done things that I don\\u2019t tell other people about\\u201d. Cronbach\\u2019s alpha for the bidimensional image management scale, specifically the communal management subscale, ranged from 0.75 to 0.91 .The selflessness scale   assesses the perception of one\\u2019s ability to act selflessly based on self-reports. The SS consists of 15 items rated on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 1  to 4 . An example of an item from the scale states, \\u201cI am willing to sacrifice a lot for the benefit of others\\u201d. Cronbach\\u2019s alpha for the selflessness scale was 0.66 .2.3. ProcedureStudents from undergraduate psychology courses at the university were asked to participate in an online study using a Qualtrics survey via SONA Systems. The survey included 116 multiple-choice questions, and each scale was scored on a 5-point Likert scale, scoring  strongly disagree to strongly agree , a 7-point Likert scale scoring  strongly disagree to strongly agree , or as a true/false scale with  false and  indicating that the statement was true. We estimated that participants would require approximately 20\\u201330 min to complete the self-report-based survey. The IRB required that participant background information be obtained before opening the survey portion and informed consent was obtained before the initiation of the survey. Upon completing the survey, each participant was debriefed, thanked, and received credit for their designated psychology course. Results from the questionnaires were then organized and analyzed using SAS software, Version 9.4 of the SAS System for Unix . Copyright \\u00a9 2020 SAS Institute Inc. SAS and all other SAS Institute Inc. product or service names are registered trademarks or trademarks of SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA.2.4. Data AnalysisThe results from the questionnaires were organized and analyzed using SAS software, Version 9.4 of the SAS System for Unix . Correlation analysis was performed for each respective independent variable with every dependent variable to assess the potential relationships between our traits of interest and the social characteristics selected. Based on our study design, we checked for the possibility of common method variance . Per Eichhorn  , we used SAS to run a non-rotated principal single-factor test to perform Harman\\u2019s single-factor test. The Harman single-factor technique estimated CMV to be 25.2%. This did not exceed the commonly accepted threshold of 50% and suggested that CMV was not influencing our findings. Regression analysis was performed to control for shared variance in our predictor variables based on Tracy et al.,   and should be interpreted in such a manner.\",\n          \"Participants aged 18 years or above and living in Australia were invited to complete an anonymous online survey on FA. The survey took approximately 20 min to complete. Exclusion criteria included being pregnant/currently lactating and being unable to comprehend English. Recruitment was undertaken over a three month period in 2016. The study was advertised through University of Newcastle media releases and promoted via a variety of social media platforms . The advertisements contained a link to the survey, and participants provided informed consent before completing the survey. Survey completers were invited to enter a prize draw to win 1 of 10 shopping vouchers . This study was approved by The University of Newcastle Ethics Committee.The survey comprehensively assessed a range of measures relating to diet and mental health which has been previously reported . The current study is a secondary analysis relating specifically to FA and BED status. Demographic information was assessed through 10 items and included information on gender, age, ethnicity, marital status, postcode, highest level of education, height, and weight, which was converted into body mass index  using standardised equations. Participants\\u2019 BMI was then classified according to World Health Organisation classifications . Postcode was used to determine the Index of Relative Socioeconomic Advantage and Disadvantage , where postcode is rated from one  to 10 .FA was assessed using the 35-item YFAS 2.0 . Each question offers a participant an option of eight responses ranging from \\u2018never\\u2019 to \\u2018every day\\u2019. Each symptom is considered met when one or more of the relevant questions for each criteria meet a predefined threshold. It provides a \\u2018diagnosis\\u2019 of FA which, depending on the number of symptoms endorsed, can be classified as \\u2018mild\\u2019, \\u2018moderate\\u2019 or \\u2018severe\\u2019. A mild diagnosis score is given when 2\\u20133 symptoms are reported, moderate when 4\\u20135 symptoms are present, and severe when 6 or more symptoms. Symptoms include tolerance, withdrawal, and loss of control with respect to eating behaviour. The YFAS 2.0 asks participants to think of specific foods such as highly processed foods; however, participants in this study were asked to consider all food. In the current study, the Cronbach alpha for this tool was 0.95, indicating acceptable internal consistency.Binge eating was assessed through the standardised BES, which comprises 16 questions. Each question requires a response consisting of three to four possible responses, reflecting a range of severity. The total score is tallied to give a score out of 46, with higher scores representing increased binge status. Based on the total score, individuals can be classified as \\u2018no binge eating\\u2019 if the score is \\u226417, \\u2018mild to moderate binge eating\\u2019 if the score is 18\\u201326, and \\u2018severe binge eating\\u2019 if the score is >27. The BES has been previously shown to have a two-factor structure, which was originally demonstrated by Gormally et al.  and confirmed more recently by Kelly et al. . These factors relate to  behavioural manifestations  including factors such as eating large amounts of food, and  feelings and cognitions  surrounding a binge eating episode including guilt, fear of not being able to stop eating, and preoccupation with eating. For the current study, in addition to the total score, the two-factor scores were also determined according to author instructions. The BES is not designed as a direct measure of BED . In the current, study the Cronbach alpha for this tool was 0.92, indicating acceptable internal consistency.Statistics: Descriptive statistics were undertaken,t-tests were used to examine differences between groups . ANOVA were used to determine differences in addiction severity . Correlation matrices for the scales for both YFAS and BES were undertaken. Also, Spearman and Pearson correlations were determined in the cases where data distribution was not normal. Both correlations produced similar results; associations between factors of the BES and between symptoms of the YFAS are presented using Pearson correlations. Correlations were determined as small , medium , or large . The correlation analysis between scales used for this study has been undertaken in previous health research . The results presented are for complete cases, with 869 of the 1344 respondents who started the survey having answered all questions. A missing value analysis was undertaken, and the demographics of those with missing values were compared, with no patterns identified. Therefore, there was no imputation of data for missing values. Due to the multiple statistical tests completed as part of this analysis, data were adjusted using a Bonferroni correction with a lower statistical threshold, and a statistical significance ofp< 0.01. Data was analysed using SPSS version 22.0 .\",\n          \"Respondents in this study were students at normal universities in Ningxia. 215 questionnaires were collected online through Questionnair Star , then, 52 invalid cases  were deleted, therefore, a total of 163 valid questionnaires were kept. According to the results of the demographic survey, the participants comprised 68 men  and 95 women . Among them, there were 59 freshman , 21 sophomore , and 83 three-grade students .We measured achievement motivation using the Achievement Motivation Scale  . There are two dimensions of achievement motivation: pursuing success  and avoiding failure . The five-point Likert scale was used. Numerical numbers were given to represent the level of agreement of each item . The total score is obtained by subtracting the score of the avoiding failure dimension from the score of the pursuing success dimension. A higher mean on this scale indicates higher achievement motivation while a lower mean indicates lower achievement motivation. Test\\u2013retest reliability of the Achievement Motivation Scale is 0.77.We evaluated students\\u2019 self-efficacy using the General Self-efficacy Scale  with 10 items . The four-point Likert scale was used. Numerical numbers were given to represent the level of agreement of each item . The coefficient of internal consistency of the General Self-efficacy Scale is 0.91.We measured time management using the Time Management Questionnaire  . There are three dimensions of time management in this study: time value , time monitoring , and time efficacy . Among them, there are 5 negative items. The five-point Likert scale was used. Numerical numbers were given to represent the level of agreement of each item . A higher mean on this scale indicates higher time management while a lower mean indicates lower time management. Negative items were reversed and implemented by assigning the highest value  to the lowest response and the lowest value  to the highest response. The test\\u2013retest reliability of the Time Management Questionnaire and its dimensions is between 0.71 and 0.85, and the Cronbach Alpha value is between 0.61 and 0.81.We measured general well-being using the General Well-being Scale   . There are six dimensions of general well-being in this study: friendship , freedom , achievement , family , environment , and school . There are 5 negative items. The seven-point Likert scale was used. Numerical numbers were given to represent the level of agreement of each item . A higher mean on this scale indicates higher general well-being while a lower mean indicates lower general well-being. The coefficient of stability of the General Well-being Scale and its dimensions is between 0.67 and 0.82, and the Cronbach Alpha value is between 0.71 and 0.91.Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects involved in the study. All respondents were informed that the information they provide, and their identity remain confidential.Descriptive statistics, at-test, an ANOVA, and a correlation analysis of the variables were all performed using SPSS 23.0. The SPSS PROCESS macro was used to the test hypotheses .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Section 3.

Both self-reported appearance vanity and achievement vanity revealed significant positive relationships with grandiose narcissism. In addition, self-reported appearance vanity and achievement vanity were positively associated with vulnerable narcissism. In accordance with our predictions, self-reported vulnerable narcissism and grandiose narcissism revealed positive relationships with hubristic pride. Our results also confirmed our prediction that an individual with vulnerable narcissism would report a significant negative relationship with authentic pride. In contrast, self-reported grandiose narcissism showed a significant positive relationship with authentic pride.Table 1.Means, Cronbach alphas, and correlations between narcissism, vanity, pride, empathy, bondedness, selflessness, and communal image management.CriterionGran.

Differences in the correlations were reported as significant, with self-reported appearance vanity evidencing a stronger relationship with authentic pride . Self-reported achievement vanity also had a small positive association with hubristic pride. Differences between the correlations of achievement vanity and hubristic pride and vulnerable narcissism and hubristic pride were non-significant. Self-reported appearance vanity was not significantly associated with hubristic pride.As noted, prior work has found that people reporting higher levels of trait narcissism lack the ability to empathize or endorse empathetic values. Our prediction aligns with the finding of a slight inverse relationship between self-reported grandiose narcissism and empathy. However, the finding of a slight positive correlation between self-reported vulnerable narcissism and empathy contradicts our predictions. We predicted that people\\u2019s self-reported vanity would also report empathy. However, the results revealed that self-reported achievement and appearance vanity had no significant relationships with empathy.We then considered the predictors of narcissism and vanity with theoretical social behavior outcome variables. Individuals who reported grandiose narcissism were found to have a significant negative relationship with sensitivity to others. In contrast, self-reported vulnerable narcissism positively correlated with sensitivity to others. Individuals with self-reported appearance vanity and achievement vanity had non-significant relationships with sensitivity to others. Self-reported grandiose narcissism and vulnerable narcissism revealed significant negative relationships with communal image management). Likewise, self-reported achievement vanity and communal image management revealed a slightly negative relationship, whereas self-reported appearance vanity was not significant. While individuals with vulnerable narcissism reported a small negative relationship with selflessness, self-reported grandiose narcissism revealed a much stronger negative association with selflessness. Participants who reported higher levels of achievement vanity and appearance vanity had non-significant relationships with selflessness.A series of regressions were run on pride and empathy, where we simultaneously entered grandiose narcissism, vulnerable narcissism, appearance vanity, and achievement vanity as predictors, as shown inTable 2. This aimed to control for any potential shared variance that these predictors might have had in the correlation analysis. For empathy, self-reported grandiose narcissism as a negative predictor held in the regression, whereas the relationship between self-reported vulnerable narcissism and empathy was reduced to non-significance. Self-reported achievement and appearance vanity remained non-significant to empathy. For authentic pride, self-reported vulnerable narcissism held as a negative predictor in the regression, and self-reported appearance vanity and grandiose narcissism held as positive predictors. Achievement vanity\\u2019s relationship to authentic pride was reduced to non-significance. Regarding hubristic pride, self-reported grandiose and vulnerable narcissism remained positive predictors, while achievement vanity was reduced to non-significance. Appearance vanity remained non-significant.Table 2.Regression analyses controlling for shared variance and predicting pride and empathy traits related to narcissism and vanity.Dependent VariableGrandioseNarcissismVulnerableNarcissismAppearance VanityAchievement VanityEmpathy\\u22120.15 ** 0.06 0.01 0.02 Authentic pride0.38 ** \\u22120.27 ** 0.19 ** 0.03 Hubristic pride0.56 ** 0.18 ** \\u22120.02 0.001 Open in a new tabNote: All scales have N = 441. **p< 0.001.Another series of regressions were run on all social behavior outcome variables.

This was executed to control for any potential shared variance between these predictors, as discussed in the previous regression. Regarding sensitivity to others, self-reported grandiose narcissism remained a negative predictor, whereas self-reported vulnerable narcissism remained a positive predictor. Self-reported achievement vanity remained non-significant for sensitivity to others. Interestingly, self-reported appearance vanity became a positive predictor for sensitivity to others. For selflessness, self-reported grandiose and vulnerable narcissism remained negative predictors, while vanity predictors remained non-significant. Regardingcommunal image management, self-reported grandiose and vulnerable narcissism remained as negative predictors. However, the relationship between achievement vanity and communal image management was reduced to non-significance, while appearance vanity remained non-significant in the regression model.Table 3.Regression analyses controlling for shared variance and predicting theoretical constructs related to narcissism and vanity.Dependent VariableGrandiose NarcissismVulnerable NarcissismAppearance VanityAchievement VanitySensitivity to others\\u22120.30 * 0.16 * 0.12 * \\u22120.05 Selflessness\\u22120.27 ** \\u22120.17 ** 0.02 0.009 Communal image management\\u22120.60 ** \\u22120.29 ** \\u22120.06 \\u22120.04 Open in a new tabNote: All scales have N = 441. *p< 0.05 **p< 0.001.\",\n          \"3.1.

Relationships between Students\\u2019 Achievement Motivation, Self-Efficacy, Time Management, and Well-BeingIn this study, Pearson\\u2019s correlation was chosen to represent the relationship between students\\u2019 achievement motivation, general self-efficacy, time management, and general well-being.Table 4shows that the correlations are all significant, and the values are between 0.250 and 0.545. The value of the Pearson Correlation between achievement motivation and general well-being was 0.250, so there was a significant low positive relationship between achievement motivation and general well-being. The result revealed that students who have high achievement motivation tend to have high general well-being. The table shows that the relationship between self-efficacy and general well-being was a significant low positive relationship as well . The result implied that students with high self-efficacy tend to have high general well-being. The results from the Pearson\\u2019s Correlation statistics analysis showed that there was a significant moderate relationship between time management and general well-being . The result also implied that students who have high time management tend to have high general well-being.Table 4.Correlations.1231achievement motivation12self-efficacy0.331 **3time management0.352 **0.455 **4general well-being0.250 **0.252 **0.545 **Open in a new tab**p< 0.01.3.4.

Characterization of Vanity: Pride and an Absence of Social BehaviorAuthentic pride was the main characteristic we identified as significantly associated with self-reported vanity. When a participant self-reported elevated levels of vanity, those participants also self-reported higher levels of \\u201cconfidence\\u201d, \\u201cself-worth\\u201d, \\u201cfulfillment\\u201d, etc., from the subscale of authentic pride . Goals or ideals established based on vanity may allow individuals to celebrate actions that bring them pride when accomplished. The regression confirmed in our data that appearance vanity is independently associated with authentic pride, while achievement vanity was reduced to non-significance. We consider that a sense of authentic pride in individuals may be more associated with appearance vanity than achievement vanity. On the downside, achievement vanity and hubristic pride also evidenced a slight positive correlation, though this was reduced to non-significance in the regression. We speculate that this small correlation reveals a shared variance between self-reported achievement vanity and a predictor of narcissism, specifically vulnerable narcissism, as vulnerable narcissism resulted as a positive predictor of hubristic pride. Overall, this finding supports the positive relationship between vanity and authentic pride, though we suggest that further research be conducted regarding distinguishing the vanity subtypes and pride types. This is consistent with previous observations that vanity and pride share similar connotations . While we would argue against vanity and pride being synonymous based on their differing underlying motivations, the fact that pride is classified as an emotion supports authentic pride as internalized via vanity. Vanity is driven by a core motivation of intrinsic goals to enhance one\\u2019s appearance and/or achievement status. If one perceives those goals to be achieved, a result of authentic pride will occur.In addition to a characterization of pride, we found both vanity subtypes to be characterized by a lack of empathy and a lack of reported relationships with the selected social behavior variables. While self-reported achievement vanity revealed a slight correlation with communal image management, this was reduced to non-significance in the regression and is suggestive that shared variance from other predictors resulted in the previous correlation. Interestingly, a non-significant correlation between self-reported appearance vanity and sensitivity to others became a positive predictor\\u2013outcome relationship when the regression was run; this suggests that the appearance vanity subtype may be characterized by sensitivity to the reactions and opinions of others where achievement vanity is not and became evident once shared variance between predictors was controlled for. This finding or, rather, the lack of overall findings with social outcomes, suggests that the construct of vanity appears to lack the empirical support to justify considering it as a distinct personality construct.4.2. Revisiting the Characterization of NarcissismWhen assessing the dimensions of narcissism, our results largely corroborate previous literature. Our hypotheses were correct concerning the facets of pride . While grandiose narcissism reported an expected inverse relationship with empathy, vulnerable narcissism revealed a positive relationship with empathy. Interestingly, the association between self-reported vulnerable narcissism and empathy is consistent with previous findings; vulnerable narcissists tend to self-report empathy . Previous literature finds that the type of empathy a vulnerable narcissist can exhibit is often associated with maladaptive aspects of empathy, such as maladaptive affective empathy or empathic distress . Our measure included items with a central theme of internalizing others\\u2019 distressing situations in empathic ability . Items such as \\u201csuffer from others\\u2019 sorrows\\u201d or \\u201ceasily moved to tears\\u201d suggest the propensity to experience emotional distress based on someone else\\u2019s experience. Thus, in our study, vulnerable narcissists with self-reported empathy may be constrained by the dysfunctional reality of their limited abilities as they pursue their need for connections, albeit with motivation for external validation from others .Concerning the social outcome variables we selected, the results reaffirmed our understanding of the dimensions of narcissism and how they may differ or be alike. While grandiose narcissism revealed a self-reported inverse relationship with sensitivity to others, self-reported vulnerable narcissism revealed a positive relationship. Individuals with vulnerable narcissism are characterized as defensive and seek external validation due to low self-esteem and a high likelihood of insecure attachment . This is consistent with the idea that an individual with vulnerable narcissism would have a heightened sensitivity to others to seek the affirmation they need to affirm their insecure sense of self , whereas the depiction of grandiose narcissism is the opposite, with a high self-esteem reported and a sense of security within oneself . Regarding selflessness, the inverse relationships for both dimensions of narcissism leads us to conclude that these reflect the self-entitlement that both grandiose and vulnerable share as the middle ground of the narcissism spectrum model, where self-entitlement is characterized by arrogance and self-centeredness . The dimensions of narcissism also evidence communal image management, where their inverse relationships with communal image management suggest that they are avoidant to admitting wrongdoing or immoral behavior. Overall, our findings are aligned with the current conception of narcissism as a spectrum model.4.3. Vanity\\u2019s Relationship to Narcissism: Where Does It Fall on the Narcissism Spectrum Model?While vanity can be identified with characterizations of authentic pride, we believe that the lack of relationship patterns with the various social characteristics we assessed is evidence of a lack of depth to vanity in the realm of personality and does not appear to be a distinct construct apart from narcissism in personality. Personality constructs, such as narcissism, are stable and succinct predictors of other social characteristics we possess, where in turn, personality heavily influences our social behavior. Our results are in line with previous findings such that vanity, in personality, would be classified as a facet of narcissism, and this remains true using the most recent conceptual model of narcissism . This is supported by our finding that both subtypes of vanity revealed significant positive relationships with both dimensions of narcissism while lacking relationships with most social outcome variables considered.The concluding aim of our discussion is to consider where vanity best aligns with the narcissism spectrum model. Based on the results, we propose that both subtypes of vanity align best with grandiose narcissism. Self-reported grandiose narcissism and both subtypes of vanity reveal positive relationships with authentic pride and positive relationships with hubristic pride for grandiose narcissism and achievement vanity only. While self-reported vulnerable narcissism also has a relationship with hubristic pride, we find support that vanity and grandiose narcissism share more similarities after considering their relationships withbothfacets of pride.Vanity as a facet of grandiose narcissism reflects a potentially improved theoretical understanding of the underlying mechanism behind grandiose narcissism\\u2019s relationship with pride and how this contributes to its traditional characterization. The core motivation of vanity, based on social comparison theory, helps us best explain this possible mechanism. Because an individual with grandiose narcissism is identified with extraversion and exhibitionism, it would make sense to utilize social comparison  to monitor their grandiose image, self-esteem, and self-concept. Suppose grandiose individuals perceive their appearance or achievement as satisfactory based on their self-evaluation relevant to their reference group. In that case, they experience authentic pride and feel accomplished via their actions and behaviors. Their grandiosity and vain concerns with themselves fuel hubris, as evidenced in our results. While they may feel accomplished based on a specific goal that was met regarding their appearance or achievement, and evidence of authentic pride, this will also reaffirm their grandiose perceptions of themselves and the potential to develop hubris. Thus, a cycle arises: vanity utilizes social comparison to present an opportunity for a sense of authentic pride, which then can feed a grandiose perception of self that then reaffirms a hubristic and global pride about oneself, complementing their extraversion and high self-esteem. This characterization driven by vanity is best suited to grandiose narcissism, as an individual with vulnerable narcissism evidences hubristic pride because they are guided by shame and defensiveness of themselves and lack a sense of authentic pride. These theoretical implications further strengthen our view of vanity as a facet of grandiose narcissism.The proposal of vanity as a facet of grandiose narcissism is supported by the previous literature as well as established work. The study by Brown  that we base our research question on revealed in their findings that the NPI sub-measure of vanity evidenced a stronger correlation with their grandiose narcissism measure than their measure for vulnerable narcissism. Utilizing a more comprehensive measure of vanity, we provide further support for vanity as a facet of narcissism aligned with the grandiose dimension of the narcissism spectrum model.4.4. Theoretical Implications Regarding the Motivational Dynamics of Vanity and NarcissismThe lack of a relationship between the selected social outcomes and vanity fosters a deeper understanding of the motivational core of vanity. It may be that vanity\\u2019s deep focus on intrinsic personal goals and values maintains a desired self-image  and contributes to the social behavior void observed; this suggests that vanity is primarily motivated by the individuals themselves to meet their own needs and goals, in contrast to narcissism that is historically socially motivated to meet the individual\\u2019s needs and goals.Social comparison theory, as discussed in the introduction, is based on the assumption that individuals determine their self-worth based on how they perceive themselves relative to others in close peer groups and is indicative of vanity . While they may be utilizing social comparison to assess their own status relative to their appearance and/or achievement goals, the act itself is not objectively social. Rather, the individual is motivated on their own account of what they perceive as a need or a want for their own ideals and uses their social environment as a baseline to assess where they stand with their expectations and desires.Narcissism, on the other hand, reflects a social motivation at its core in our finding of identified relationships with the selected social outcomes. Indeed, individuals with elevated levels of narcissism exhibit social activity as narcissism itself seeks social validation to maintain itself. While narcissism is a focus on the self, sometimes at an exaggerated and maladaptive level, it is rooted in being motivated socially to affirm one\\u2019s preferred feelings about oneself. Simply put, both dimensions of narcissism are part of a socially contingent personality construct that motivates individuals to manage their self-image and self-concept via social experiences and interactions. While it is not inaccurate to characterize both vanity and narcissism with self-involvement, it is important to discuss how these differ at their core. We conclude that vanity is best retained as a facet of grandiose narcissism, especially within the narcissism spectrum model. One key contribution of our study is the improved understanding of the motivational dynamics of vanity and narcissism, in particular our understanding of how the two interact and, thus, contribute to personality.4.5. Limitations and Future ResearchA few aspects limit the research. With evidence supporting vanity to be stronger linked to grandiose narcissism, we do acknowledge that in our study we did not include a measure for self-entitlement. Self-entitlement is the middle ground point of the narcissism spectrum model in addition to the grandiose and vulnerable dimensions of narcissism . It is becoming more widely measured in addition to grandiose and vulnerable narcissism scales. While we sought to examine how vanity would relate to both profoundly distinct dimensions of narcissism, we recognize that examining the relationship between self-entitlement and vanity would be beneficial. We encourage future research on self-entitlement and vanity to understand further how vanity aligns with the narcissism spectrum model. We acknowledge that in a self-report design survey regarding personality constructs, the participants\\u2019 responses are subject to self-enhancement and halo effect biases . The age of the participant group is a potential limitation; younger individuals are more likely to be influenced by external opinions as well. Our participants are all young undergraduate students who may face additional environmental influences. Thus, results may have revealed different findings if the study had been performed in a different sample. Future research would benefit from considering alternative data collection methods to assess narcissism and vanity. Future research should also consider vanity, other types or traits of social behavior, and social scenarios to further contribute to vanity\\u2019s characterization  of social behavior.\",\n          \"This study investigated the overlap in symptoms of FA and BED as measured by the YFAS 2.0 and the BES\\u2019s emotional and behavioural factors. It was found that substantial overlap  exists between the commonly used assessment tools in a sample of Australian adults from a wide age range, which concurs with existing research . However, this is the first study to demonstrate that the strongest overlap occurred with the BES emotion factor, while less overlap was observed with the BES behaviour factor. This was evidenced by larger correlation values with the BES emotion factor, compared with very few strong correlations  with the BES behaviour factor. The behaviour factor relates to behavioural expressions surrounding a binge eating episode which showed small to moderate correlations with the majority of the 11 symptoms assessed by the YFAS 2.0 tool. These correlations are not unexpected, as previous findings indicate that individuals with co-existing FA and BED experience significantly higher levels of depression, negative affect, poorer emotion dysregulation, and lower self-esteem . This would seem to indicate that high levels of emotional and psychosocial distress accompany both eating pathologies. Research has demonstrated that, in the context of binge eating, emotions and behaviour rarely occur exclusively  and are correlated as shown in this study. For this reason, it would be expected that both features be present and it is unsurprising that these symptoms would co-occur in FA. However, strong evidence for the cognitive and behavioural aspects of BED is lacking, and further investigations into BED and behaviour are warranted.It is important to attempt to articulate the unique features that may set the construct of FA apart from BED, given that previous overlaps have been shown, although these are not in entirety or not 100% overlapping. In this study, it appears that several symptoms are unique to FA, as evidenced by lower correlation valueswith BES. Specifically, small associations were found with FA symptoms of \\u2018consumed more than planned\\u2019 or \\u2018use in physically hazardous situations\\u2019; the latter symptom in this study actually showed significant negative relationships. The symptom of \\u2018use in physically hazardous situations\\u2019 has previously been debated as a difficult factor to interpret in relation to food, given that food in its true sense is needed for survival. Recent studies assessing FA using the YFAS 2.0 tool have found the endorsement of \\u2018use in physically hazardous situations\\u2019 symptom in three non-clinical samples  to have low endorsement rates ranging from 9.1% to 24.8%; with two of the studies reporting the endorsement rate in FA individuals  as 37.0% and 68.3%, respectively . However, in the context of FA, this symptom can be described as causing impairment to performance, such as eating while driving, or impairment to health that is hazardous. In the context of obesity and related metabolic syndrome risk factors, this could include the consequences of individuals with diabetes, dyslipidaemia, or hypertension overconsuming foods containing excessive amounts of sugar, fat, or sodium . However, this symptom may not have been well-reported by participants with this rationale in mind nor understood in terms of addiction by the participants completing the surveys, thus influencing the results because the questions did not ask participants to consider this aspect of the symptom. Existing public views suggest that individuals believe some foods are addictive and that addiction can cause obesity . Future qualitative work on FA is warranted to better understand how the symptoms are experienced and if they differ for each individual, particularly as this field is still emerging.The FA symptom of \\u201closs of control with respect to eating behaviour\\u201d overlaps with that of \\u201closs of control over eating\\u201d, the latter being a core eating disorder behaviour and a diagnostic criterion for the eating disorders bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder . The symptoms of FA as assessed by the YFAS were determined with mapping to the DSM\\u20135. However, it is noted that when considering some of these symptoms at a broader population level, with increasing prevalence rates of overweight and obesity, some symptoms or traits presently being assessed overlap with general dieting practices undertaken by many individuals. FA symptoms measured by the YFAS, specifically \\u2018repeated attempts to cut down food\\u2019, may not be unique to FA, but apply to the population in general.In the current analysis of those individuals with FA, 72.7% also had reported BES scores which related to either moderate or severe bingeing. While not directly comparable due to the use of different tools and methods to assess the disordered eating status, the value in the current study is higher than that previously reported by Gearhardt et al., who found in a sample of overweight individuals with BED, determined by clinical interview, that 57% met the classification for FA . In a more racially diverse sample of obese, treatment-seeking adults with BED  as assessed by an alternate tool, The Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire , the findings were similar, with 42% of participants meeting the classification for FA . In both studies, YFAS scores were also significant predictors of binge eating frequency. In an additional study, Ivezaj et al.  examined the eating and health-related behaviours of overweight/obese adults , and found that 61.7% of adults meeting BED criteria as assessed by the EDEQ also met FA criteria. Adults with co-occurring BED and FA had significantly higher BMI and depression scores, combined with greater disturbances on most impulsivity and self-control measures relative to the control group . A strong association between FA and BE severity  as well as a moderate association between FA and measures of general psychopathology were reported. A similar relationship between FA and BE has also been shown to exist in younger adolescent populations .Rates of FA among those with BED is higher in individuals with obesity than in those who are not obese ; this was also shown in the current study across increasing weight status of healthy, overweight, and obese participants. Individuals who meet the criteria for both BED and FA tend to exhibit more frequent binge eating episodes, experience stronger cravings for food, and elevated levels of impulsivity and depressive symptoms than those with only BED . It has been suggested the co-occurrence of BED and FA may represent a more severe BED subgroup characterised by greater eating disorder psychopathology and associated pathology .Recent evidence suggests altered reward sensitivity may contribute to the pathophysiology of disordered eating behaviours. A review of neuroimaging studies  in BED found that the alterations in corticostriatal circuitry were similar to those observed in substance abuse, including altered function of prefrontal, insular, and orbitofrontal cortices and the striatum . Preliminary evidence by Gearhardt et al. suggests that reward dysfunction may also be a relevant mechanism in the FA construct . Human genetics and animal studies suggest that changes in neurotransmitter networks, including dopaminergic and opioidergic systems, are associated with compulsive-eating behaviours .This study has several limitations which should be considered when interpreting the findings: the survey was collected online and is based on self-report measures and was analysed using correlation analysis only. However, it is noted that for food addiction and binge eating, the majority of measures used for these eating behaviours are based on self-report, and self-reported height and weight have been shown previously to be a valid measure of weight status . It could be likely that individuals who are motivated by food may have been more likely to complete the survey. The study sample had a majority of participants who were female, so results may not be generalisable to the broader population or to other ethnicities. The findings of this study have some clinical implications, as they provide a further understanding of the underlying aetiology of co-occurring FA and BED, to progress and tailor treatment options as FA appears to be more physiological than behavioural in nature.\",\n          \"As shown inTable 2, there were no statistically significant differences in achievement motivation, self-efficacy, time management, and general well-being between genders. This may be because male students and female students are under the same learning pressure, so there is no significant difference in time management. Although the role requirements and parenting styles of boys and girls are different in society and some families, on the whole, the status of boys and girls is relatively equal.When students\\u2019 achievement motivation is strong, they often have the need to pursue success. In order to achieve success, they need to set corresponding goals. The achievement goal theory holds that goals play a guiding role and are an important dynamic mechanism for learners to achieve their goals. Goals will promote students to manage their time effectively . Time management disposition can show the psychological and behavioral traits of people in how they use time. The sense of time monitoring allows individuals to reasonably arrange the priority of tasks according to their goals, allocate the main time to important learning tasks, and be good at disciplining themselves. The sense of time efficacy can help individuals evaluate their own time management ability. When individuals arrange their time reasonably and achieve their goals, they will have positive emotions and higher general well-being .The relationships between self-efficacy, time management, and general well-being are amply supported by empirical data . Therefore, we put forward the view that generalized self-efficacy can enhance individuals\\u2019 general well-being through time management. College students who have higher levels of general well-being and life satisfaction have stronger adaptability, resilience, and efficient ability to deal with problems, but also work harder to complete learning tasks and achieve more success . This may be due to the fact that their strong self-efficacy beliefs may have an impact on their task selection, perseverance, effort, and academic success . In essence, self-efficacy enhances higher commitment, problem-solving abilities, goal orientation, creativity, and time management skills , so as to improve general well-being .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Section 5.

Furthermore, we found that vanity was associated with grandiose narcissism, which has been anticipated and confirmed by previous investigations. Overall, our integration of newer comprehensive models of vanity and narcissism clarifies how vanity fits into the field of personality. Our clarification of vanity is necessary to understand vanity in personality and its core motivations and to expand and clarify the narcissism spectrum model. The findings add to the popular topic of personality psychology, ultimately enhancing our understanding of narcissism, vanity, and its translation to social behavior.\",\n          \"This is one of the first studies to investigate the potential overlap between the common tools used to assess BED and FA and their individual constructs, particularly with reference to the YFAS 2.0 tool which maps to current DSM criteria. This study demonstrates the overlap between BED and FA, and highlights the possible unique differences between the forms of disordered eating.\",\n          \"The main purpose of the study is to examine the mediating role of time management in the effects of achievement motivation and self-efficacy on general well-being among students at normal universities in Ningxia. Based on the reviews of previous research and the purpose of the current study, five hypotheses has been proposed.Hypothesis1.There is a positive influence of achievement motivation on general well-being.Hypothesis2.There is a positive influence of self-efficacy on general well-being.Hypothesis3.There is a positive influence of time management on well-being.Hypothesis4.Time management mediates the relationship between achievement motivation and well-being.Hypothesis5.Time management mediates the relationship between self-efficacy and well-being.The findings showed that H1\\u2013H5 were all supported.
