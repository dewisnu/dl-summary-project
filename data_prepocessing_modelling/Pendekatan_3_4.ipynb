training data:\n {'ext_summary': 'finally, the sample was primary school students since they have received relatively limited research attention regarding these variablescompared to high school and university students.taking into account the existing literature, the research hypotheses and research question were formed as below:it is more likely that students with ld and students with rcd would report lower scores of mastery-approach goals and mastery goal structures and higher performance-avoidance goals and performance goal structures than students without difficulties;it is more likely that students with ld and students with rcd would report lower levels of adaptive self-regulating strategies (i.e., deep, motivational, persistence, and monitoring) and higher levels of surface strategies as compared to students with no difficulties;in terms of differences between the ld group and the rcd group, it is less likely that ld students would present an adaptive profile, reporting fewer mastery goals, more performance-avoidance goals, more performance goal structures, and fewer adaptive strategies;are personal goals and classroom goal structures predictors of srl strategies, and which of them is a predictor of adaptive and surface strategies separately for the three groups?. the correlations between the predictor variables of the study were examined, and they were found to be low to moderate, indicating that collinearity was unlikely to be a problem.table 2.correlations of personal goals, classroom goal structures, and strategies of self-regulated learning.personal

mastery-approach goals; pap = performance-approach goals; pav = performance-avoidance goals; m-str = mastery goal structures; p-str = performance goal structures.. on the other hand, for students with comprehension difficulties, performance classroom goals were a stronger predictor of surface strategies.. mastery-approach goals and mastery classroom goals were positive predictors of adaptive strategies of self-regulated learning for all three groups (typical students, students with learning disabilities, and students with reading comprehension difficulties).. moreover, we examined the predictors of adaptive and surface strategies for the three groups.the results of the present study showed that the students with learning disabilities and the students with comprehension difficulties were less mastery and more performance-avoidant-oriented and reported higher levels of performance goal structures as compared to students without difficulties.. moreover, for students with ld, mastery-approach goals have been positively linked with adaptive motivational and behavioral outcomes, whereas performance-avoidance goals are associated with mostly maladaptive patterns, indicating similar outcomes with students without difficulties.. in addition, performance-approach goals are more adaptive for students with low self-perceived competence.. a second aim was to explore the different patterns of predictors for adaptive and surface strategies for the three groups, aiming to investigate the outcomes of personal goals and classroom goal structures.. additionally, researchers claim that students with learning disabilities and students with reading comprehension difficulties or low-performance students, by adopting performance-approach goals, are motivated toward the achievement of a specific goal and refrain from task resignation or avoidance, so even this presence of motivation becomes beneficial as compared to the absence of any motives.. this result confirms the first hypothesis and is in line with extant research showing that students with learning disabilities and poor comprehenders present low mastery goals and avoid learning tasks because of their fear of poor performance and deficits exposure, and they usually perceive the classroom context as performance-oriented.in terms of self-regulated strategies, students with learning disabilities and reading comprehension difficulties reported more surface strategies than their typical peers, partly confirming the second hypothesis and the existing literature.. finally, performance-avoidance goals focus on avoiding failure and avoiding demonstrating lack of ability relative to others.given that personal attitudes and students’ motivation toward learning tasks are gradually shaped by the influence received from familiar surroundings, including the school classroom setting and the opposite, goal achievement theory has been extended from the individual-level construct to the characteristics of the educational setting, formingclassroom goal structures.. as far as their goal orientation is concerned, given that they have difficulties in more than one learning area, it is expected that they adopt fewer mastery-approach goals and more performance-avoidance goals, probably in order to avoid exposure of their weak areas.. in addition, performance-avoidance goals were found to be negatively correlated with effective strategies of self-regulationand school performance.as with personal achievement goals, students’ perceptions of mastery classroom goals or goal structures have been associated with positive behavior patterns, such as mastery goals, deep strategies, effort, internal motives, help-seeking, support autonomy, and positive affect.. in the case of ld students, mastery goals had a lower impact as a predictor of adaptive strategies.. this finding confirmed that mastery orientation personal goals and classroom mastery orientation goals are associated with positive behavior models at a cognitive level, not only for the group without any known difficulties but also for students with learning disabilities and reading comprehension difficulties.. at the same time, the importance of performance-approach goals for more adaptive learning behaviors, in the case of poor-performance students, is not to be understated.. this result confirms the extant literature that supports the less adaptive character of one’s performance-avoidance goals toward learning behaviors and school performance.. consequently, this finding highlights that avoidance orientation is the one negatively linked to adaptive behaviors for all students, while the effect of performance-approach goals warrants further research.taking the above results into consideration, emphasis is put on the value of classroom goals and personal mastery goals for learning, but also on the negative effect of personal performance-avoidance goals for all students, regardless of their presented difficulties.. drawing from the achievement goal theoretical model, the present study explores personal and classroom goals and their link to the self-regulating strategies of students with rcd compared to students with ld and a group with no difficulties.1.1.. more specifically, performance-avoidance goals negatively predicted adaptive strategies of self-regulated learning in all groups.. the questionnaire contains 2 subscales, mastery goal structures (m-str) (e.g., “the teacher tells us that mistakes don’t matter”) and performance goal structures (p-str) (e.g., “during the lesson, there is a lot of competition between students”) (m-str α = 0.89, α = 0.85, α = 0.91; p-str α = 0.87, α = 0.91, α = 0.89 for nd, ld, rcd groups, respectively).2.2.3. strategies of self-regulated learningchildren’s perceived use of self-regulated learning inventoryis a self-report tool that assesses students’ self-regulation in school tasks.. this result concurs with other findings and confirms the adaptive character of mastery goals and the corresponding classroom goal structures for all students.. the aim of the present study was to explore self-reported goal orientations, classroom goal structures, and strategies of self-regulated learning of students with learning disabilities, students with reading comprehension difficulties, and students with no difficulties.. finally, there are a few results highlighting the importance of mastery goal structures in reading comprehension, indicating that performance goal structures are associated with less positive affect and less engagement, adopting the opposite pattern of mastery goal structures.1.in the present study, we examined goal orientations, classroom goal structures, and strategies of srl in three separate groups: students with ld, students with rcd, and students with no difficulties, with the aim of describing their motivational profiles.. different goal orientations are associated with different, more or less adaptive behaviors in the school context.especially for students with learning disabilities (ld), for whom motivation is of primary importance for learning involvement and achievement, research on achievement goals is relatively limited and the findings conflicting.', 'Abstract_clean': 'the aim of the present study was to investigate goal orientations and classroom goal structures and their relationship with strategies of self-regulated learning (srl) in students with and without learning disabilities (ld) and reading comprehension difficulties (rcd). the sample consisted of 537 students attending the two last grades of primary school, fifth and sixth grade (mage = 11.28 years, sd = ±0.59). of these, 58 students were diagnosed with ld, and 70 students, after individually administered assessments in reading accuracy and reading comprehension, were assigned to the rcd group. self-reported questionnaires were administered, assessing students’ personal goal orientations, classroom goal structures, and strategies of srl. the results showed that students with ld and students with rcd scored lower in mastery orientation and higher in performance avoidance compared to their peers without difficulties (nd). ld students reported lower scores of adaptive strategies than their peers. in addition, the results confirmed the adaptive character of mastery-approach goals and mastery goal structures and the negative effects of performance-avoidance goals and performance goal structures on the adaptive strategies of srl. performance-approach goals predicted adaptive behaviors for all students, confirming the argument of an adaptive type of motivation. the findings of the current study highlight the importance of goal orientations and classroom goal structures for students’ srl. implications of the findings for enhancing motivation for students with ld and students with rcd are discussed.', '__index_level_0__':

anxiety disorder (gad) and likely major depressive disorder (mdd) among subscribers of the moregooddays program.. the results suggest that moregooddays participants who had received mental health counselling in the past were 18.5 times more likely to experience mdd symptoms compared with those who had not (or = 18.5; 95% ci: 1.55–200.00).. our findings add to the existing literature, suggesting that anxiety and depression are prevalent among adolescents and young adults and confirm the impact of the pandemic on this cohort.. during the covid-19 pandemic, one-fifth of young adults and a third of adolescents had mental health issues, including depression and generalized anxiety disorder.. univariate analysistable 4shows the results of the chi-square test of the association between demographic, clinical, and mental health characteristics and likely mdd.table 4below indicates that, overall, 16 variables had a statistically significant association in chi-square/fisher’s exact test (p< 0.05) or near significant (0.1 ≥p≥ 0.05) with likely mdd, including age, educational level, relationship status, employment status, housing status, ace score, mental health history of depression, anxiety, sud, adhd, no mental health history, on antidepressants, on sleeping tablets, on no psychotropic medication, and those who have received mental health counselling or desire to receive mental health counselling.. other studies proposed that the desire for mental health counseling may offer better insight into possible mental distress than individual clinical variables, necessitating the importance of providing prompt online psychological counseling services during the pandemic.finally, this study found that participants who had received mental health counseling in the past year were 18.5 times more likely to experience mdd symptoms than those who had not.. similarly, other studies during the pandemic reported a higher prevalence of anxiety, such as 60.8% among health science studentsand 66.86% among other respondents.the overall prevalence of likely mdd in our respondents was 56%, with a prevalence of 69.6% among participants aged 26 years or younger.. our study demonstrates that the desire for mental health counseling is the only variable that independently predicts likely gad among subscribers of the moregooddays program.. participants who expressed a desire for mental health counseling were 27 times more likely to experience gad symptoms than those who did not.. the model explained 35.8% (cox and snell r2) to 48.1% (nagelkerke r2) of the variance and correctly classified 79.3% of cases.table 3shows that only one variable, “would you like to receive mental health counselling?” independently predicted the likely presence of gad in the moregooddays participants.. for instance, a study among young adults before the covid-19 pandemic recorded a prevalence of (65%) for depression.. after controlling for all other variables in the regression model, participants who would like to receive mental health counselling were 27 times more likely to experience gad symptoms than those who did not (or = 27; 95% ci: 3.09–250.00).. the prevalence of anxiety in our study is comparable to prevalence estimates reported in other studies conducted during the pandemic.. we assessed likely generalized anxiety disorder (gad) and likely major depressive disorder (mdd) among moregooddays subscribers using the generalized anxiety disorder-7 (gad-7) scaleand the patient health questionnaire-9 (phq-9), respectively.. despite these limitations, our study provides valuable information about the prevalence of anxiety and depression during the covid-19 pandemic and highlights the long-term impact on adolescents and young adults.. similarly, moregooddays participants who would like to receive mental health counselling were 40 times more likely to experience mdd than those who did not (or = 40.03; 95% ci: 4.43–361.51).. in contrast to these reports, our study found that a history of mental health conditions, including anxiety and depression, did not independently predict the presence of likely gad or mdd in subscribers of moregooddays.adverse childhood experiences have long been linked to various mental health issues and may have a lifelong effect on an individual’s mental and physical health.. again, moregooddays participants who were undecided or unsure if they would like to receive mental health counselling were 29 times more likely to experience mdd than those who did not (or = 28.86; 95% ci: 3.07–271.45).. the imposed behavioural changes during the covid-19 pandemic may have also contributed to the increased number of adolescents and young adults with likely anxiety and likely depressive symptoms and other disorders at levels that require treatment.. our study aimed to assess the prevalence and predictors of likely generalized anxiety disorder (gad) and major depressive disorder (mdd) among subscribers of moregooddays, a daily supportive text message program co-created with adolescents and young adults for their peers.. the model explained 45.7% (cox and snell r2) to 60.9% (nagelkerke r2) of the variance and correctly classified 82.9% of cases.table 5shows that two variables, “have received mental health counselling in the past” and “would like to receive mental health counselling?” independently predicted the likely presence of mdd in moregooddays subscribers.. this longitudinal study also found that depression diagnosis independently predicted the presence of likely gad and that the frequency of depressive episodes experienced by adolescents and young adults predicted later psychiatric outcomes, including anxiety and depression.', 'Abstract_clean': 'background: the covid-19 pandemic has increased psychological disorders among adolescents and young adults. methods: this study used a cross-sectional design. an online survey questionnaire was used to collect sociodemographic and clinical information from subscribers of moregooddays program, a daily supportive text message program co-designed with adolescents and young adults for their peers in alberta. validated instruments, the generalized anxiety disorder gad-7 scale and patient health questionnaire-9 phq-9 were used to collect information on likely gad and likely major depressive disorder (mdd). data was analyzed with spss version 25 using chi-squared tests and binary logistic regression analysis. results: 343 subscribers of moregooddays participated in the survey. overall, 117 (56.0%) respondents had a likely mdd and 97 (46.6%) had a likely gad. participants who would like to receive mental health counselling were 27 times more likely to experience gad (or = 27; 95% ci: 3.09–250.00) and 40 times more likely to experience mdd (or = 40.03; 95% ci: 4.43–361.51) than those who did not. respondents who had received mental health counselling in the past were 18.5 times more likely to experience mdd compared with those who had not (or = 18.52; 95% ci: 1.55–200.00). demographic variables, including age, education, employment, and relationship status, and clinical variables, such as history of anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, adhd, and adverse childhood experience, did not independently the predict presence of likely gad or mdd in subscribers of moregooddays. conclusion: the prevalence of anxiety and depression was relatively high among subscribers of moregooddays, indicating the long-term effect of the covid-19 pandemic. this finding has significant implications in the broader contextof mental health research and emphasizes the need for more research into innovative mental health support for this cohort. the desire to receive counselling was predictive of both anxiety and depression and is a positive sign of the openness of this cohort to receive psychological intervention. since this group is mostly adapted to mobile text technology, government agencies and policymakers should prioritize and implement readily accessible interventions such as supportive text messages to support their psychological well-being.',

factors encompass demographic and sociological characteristics, enabling factors to cover aspects influencing the ability to use medical services and need factors pertaining to physical and mental health challenges.in a study examining college students’ covid-19 vaccination intentions applying the andersen model, factors such as demographic characteristics, the influence of peers, psychological predispositions, the acquisition of covid-19 vaccine information, vaccine literacy, health status, and covid-19-related experiences were considered.. notably, psychological concerns, such as fear of covid-19 infection, decreased the odds of non-vaccination by 13% (or = 0.87, 95% ci: 0.82–0.92) compared to individuals without such concerns, while public criticism similarly reduced the odds by 9% (or = 0.91, 95% ci: 0.86–0.97).in terms of enabling factors, individuals with unmet healthcare needs had 1.54 times higher odds of non-vaccination (95% ci: 1.41–1.67) compared to those without unmet healthcare needs (reference group).. tailored psychological support and information campaigns should address these concerns to improve vaccination rates.enabling factors like unmet healthcare needs and recipients of national basic livelihood guarantees were associated with higher risks of being unvaccinated.. gender, age, education level, job status, marital status, psychological concerns about covid-19, healthcare access, unmet healthcare needs, mental health conditions, and health behaviors all significantly shaped vaccination patterns.. while surpassing the world health organization’s vaccination target, there is an ongoing need to investigate factors influencing vaccination rates, particularly among the unvaccinated population.. international studies have indicated lower vaccination intentions among women, younger individuals, those with lower education, and individuals in non-medical majors and occupations.. furthermore, psychological concerns, such as fear of covid-19 infection, were associated with a 1.21 times increase in the odds of non-vaccination (95% ci: 1.15–1.26) compared to those without such concerns.in the multivariate logistic regression analysis, after adjusting for all variables, the risk of covid-19 non-vaccination increased by 1.63 times for individuals aged 19–64 (95% ci: 1.52–1.74) compared to those aged 65 or older (reference group).. non-vaccination rates were notably elevated among individuals aged 19–64 (71.4%), females (56.1%), those without an occupation (55.5%), individuals without a spouse (42.9%), those with education below the high school level (55.4%), individuals with psychological concerns about covid-19 infection (60.3%) and economic repercussions (50.6%), those lacking psychological concerns about covid-19 public criticism (55.5%), individuals with experienced unmet healthcare needs (9.6%), recipients of national basic livelihood guarantees (9.5%), urban residents (60.9%), individuals reporting higher subjective health (35.2%), those experiencing stress (74.8%), individuals with depression (24.8%), those without chronic diseases (73.3%), individuals who currently smoke (18.2%), those not currently drinking alcohol (73.3%), and those not having breakfast (60.4%).table 1.general characteristics of covid-19 vaccination.variabletotal %unvaccinated %vaccinated %ppredisposing

onset of covid-19 in january 2020 heralded an unparalleled global health crisis, leading to widespread fatalities and significant lifestyle changes. the virus’s highly contagious nature, coupled with the emergence of mutated strains, continues to pose concerns about sustained transmission and enduring societal impacts. despite global vaccination efforts, covid-19 remains a substantial challenge. vaccination is pivotal not only for preventing infection but also for reducing the severity and risk of death from the virus. while surpassing the world health organization’s vaccination target, there is an ongoing need to investigate factors influencing vaccination rates, particularly among the unvaccinated population. as new infectious diseases persist, research becomes crucial to enhance community vaccination rates.prior studies have applied andersen’s model to discern factors affecting vaccination intentions. the andersen model, designed to predict individual use of medical services, categorizes factors into predisposing, enabling, and need factors. predisposing factors encompass demographic and sociological characteristics, enabling factors to cover aspects influencing the ability to use medical services and need factors pertaining to physical and mental health challenges.in a study examining college students’ covid-19 vaccination intentions applying the andersen model, factors such as demographic characteristics, the influence of peers, psychological predispositions, the acquisition of covid-19 vaccine information, vaccine literacy, health status, and covid-19-related experiences were considered. psychological predisposition significantly influenced college students’ covid-19 vaccination intentions. international studies have indicated lower vaccination intentions among women, younger individuals, those with lower education, and individuals in non-medical majors and occupations. a prior investigation into factors influencing covid-19 vaccination status among the elderly in china revealed that women, unmarried individuals, urban residents, and those with chronic diseases are less likely to receive the covid-19 vaccine.despite numerous studies on covid-19 in korea focusing on epidemiology, vaccine effectiveness, and vaccination intentions for specific groups, there is a scarcity of research identifying factors related to the actual vaccination of the entire korean population. this study aims to fill this gap by applying the andersen model to national-scale survey data, seeking to uncover factors influencing covid-19 vaccination and contribute to the development of community programs aimed at improving vaccination rates. additionally, it is important to address factors such as concerns about side effects, confidence in vaccine effectiveness, influence from peers and family, and policies regarding free vaccine provision to ensure a comprehensive understanding of vaccination behaviors and hesitancy.anderson modelthe andersen model, widely used in healthcare access studies, was selected for this research because it offers a comprehensive framework for understanding the multi-dimensional factors that influence health behaviors, such as covid-19 vaccination. the model divides these factors into three categories: predisposing factors (e.g., demographic and psychological characteristics), enabling factors (e.g., resources or barriers to care), and need factors (e.g., health status and perceived need for care). these categories align well with the determinants explored in this study. previous research has demonstrated the andersen model’s effectiveness in examining vaccination behavior, particularly in understanding how individual characteristics, access to healthcare, and perceived needs influence vaccination decisions. by utilizing this model, we aim to identify the various factors that contribute to covid-19 vaccination uptake among korean adults. s2.1. data and samplethis study utilized primary data from the 2022 korea community health survey (kchs) conducted by the korea disease control and prevention agency between 16 august and 31 october 2022. the kchs is an annual cross-sectional survey that employs a multistage, stratified area probability sampling method to select participants from civilian, non-institutionalized korean households. sampling is based on geographic area, age, and sex, ensuring representative data across different demographic groups. data collection was performed through one-on-one in-person interviews using standardized questionnaires administered by trained surveyors.for the purposes of this study, participants who reported receiving a covid-19 vaccination were initially considered. however, individuals who reported being unvaccinated were excluded from the final analysis. after applying these exclusion criteria, a total of 231,784 individuals were retained in the final dataset.2.2. measurement2.2.1. predisposing factorpredisposing factors refer to the demographic and psychological characteristics of individuals that may influence health behavior. in this study, age was categorized into two groups: 19–64 and 65 or older. gender was classified as either male or female. job status was divided into those with an occupation and those without. spouse status was categorized based on whether participants had a spouse or not, including those who were never married, divorced, or widowed. education level was classified as either below high school graduate or college and above. lastly, psychological concerns related to covid-19 were measured by asking participants to rate their level of concern in three specific areas: (1) concern about infection, (2) concern about public criticism, and (3) concern about economic damage.in this study, psychological concerns related to covid-19, such as fear of infection and economic anxiety, were considered part of predisposing factors. this is in line with the andersen model, which allows for psychological characteristics to be included as individual-level factors influencing health behavior. although these factors could also be viewed sociologically, they are incorporated here as predisposing influences based on individual perceptions and experiences.2.2.2. enabling factorsenabling factors refer to conditions that either facilitate or hinder access to healthcare services. in this study, unmet healthcare needs were assessed by asking participants, “over the past year, have you ever felt that you could not or did not access medical services when needed?” responses were categorized as either “yes” or “no”. the status of being a recipient of the national basic livelihood guarantee, a form of government-provided social assistance, was also considered. additionally, region of residence was categorized based on participants’ living locations, grouped as either urban or rural areas.2.2.3. need factorsneed factors most directly reflect access to medical care by highlighting disease characteristics. in this study, subjective health, stress, depression, chronic diseases, current smoking, current alcohol drinking, and eating breakfast were included. subjective health was categorized as “very bad, bad, normal, good, and very good” and later reclassified as “above good” and “below normal”. depression was assessed using the patient health questionnaire-9 (phq-9), recommended with a cutoff score of 5(park et al., 2010). chronic diseases included diagnosed hypertension and diabetes. current smoking was determined by the question: “do you smoke now?” current alcohol drinking refers to those who consumed alcohol within the past month.2.statistical analyses were performed using ibm spss statistics v21.0 (ibm corp., armonk, ny, usa). categorical variables were presented as proportions and compared using chi-square tests to identify differences between groups. binary logistic regression was used as the outcome variable (vaccination status), which was dichotomous.both univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the factors associated with covid-19 vaccination. univariate logistic regression was first employed to assess the crude relationships between each independent variable and the dependent variable (covid-19 vaccination status). this step allowed us to identify the raw associations without adjusting for potential confounders.following the univariate analysis, multiple logistic regression was performed to adjust for confounding variables and determine the independent effects of each predictor on vaccination status. variables that were significant in the univariate analysis (p< 0.05) were included in the multivariate model. the results were presented as odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals. sthe outcomes presented intable 1illustrate an analysis of covid-19 vaccination patterns concerning predisposing, enabling, and need factors. among the participants, 3.4% reported being unvaccinated. the frequencies and percentage distributions of each categorical variable related to covid-19 vaccination were derived using the χ2test. non-vaccination rates were notably elevated among individuals aged 19–64 (71.4%), females (56.1%), those without an occupation (55.5%), individuals without a spouse (42.9%), those with education below the high school level (55.4%), individuals with psychological concerns about covid-19 infection (60.3%) and economic repercussions (50.6%), those lacking psychological concerns about covid-19 public criticism (55.5%), individuals with experienced unmet healthcare needs (9.6%), recipients of national basic livelihood guarantees (9.5%), urban residents (60.9%), individuals reporting higher subjective health (35.2%), those experiencing stress (74.8%), individuals with depression (24.8%), those without chronic diseases (73.3%), individuals who currently smoke (18.2%), those not currently drinking alcohol (73.3%), and those not having breakfast (60.4%).table 1.general characteristics of covid-19 vaccination.variabletotal %unvaccinated %vaccinated %ppredisposing

in south korea using data from the 2022 korea community health survey (kchs). given that vaccination is one of the most cost-effective measures during public health crises, the andersen model was employed to provide a comprehensive framework for assessing the factors influencing vaccination decisions. the findings are consistent with previous studies while also revealing new insights into vaccination behavior in south korea.predisposing factors, such as age, gender, job status, marital status, education level, and psychological concerns about covid-19, significantly impact covid-19 vaccination. individuals over 65, females, those employed, and those with spouses exhibited a lower risk of being unvaccinated, aligning with previous findings. this trend could be attributed to the national vaccination program’s focus on individuals aged 65 and older, which successfully increased vaccination rates in this group. interestingly, individuals with higher education (college level and above) showed a greater risk of being unvaccinated. this result contradicts some prior findings, suggesting that more research is needed to explore the influence of education on vaccine hesitancy. psychological concerns related to covid-19 underscore the need for psychological support programs, considering the psychological impact on the vaccination group. in preparing covid-19 countermeasures, addressing psychological and social aspects, tailored to the varying levels of psychological concern, is imperative. effective intervention and support systems are vital as community residents’ psychological concerns can influence their health and behavior. tailored psychological support and information campaigns should address these concerns to improve vaccination rates.enabling factors like unmet healthcare needs and recipients of national basic livelihood guarantees were associated with higher risks of being unvaccinated. these findings underscore the necessity of targeted interventions for socially vulnerable populations, such as economically disadvantaged groups, who may face barriers to accessing healthcare. providing reliable information on the safety and efficacy of vaccines, coupled with support systems, could improve vaccination coverage in these communities. social distancing measures and the pandemic’s broader social impacts have further exacerbated the challenges for these populations.need factors, including subjective health, depression, current smoking, and skipping breakfast, were also associated with a higher risk of being unvaccinated. people reporting poor subjective health or depression often display vaccine hesitancy, necessitating motivational and educational programs. the association between smoking and vaccine distrust reflects the need for targeted interventions aimed at smokers, as smoking may contribute to vaccine hesitancy. skipping breakfast, often linked to poor nutrition, could impair immune functionand thus influence attitudes toward vaccination. interestingly, those with chronic diseases were less likely to be unvaccinated, suggesting that they understand the preventive benefits of vaccination, which is consistent with previous studies. however, the lower risk of being unvaccinated among current drinkers contradicted earlier research, highlighting the need for further investigation.4.1. strengths and limitationsthis study benefits from the use of a large, nationally representative dataset, enhancing the generalizability of its findings. the application of the andersen model also allows for a structured analysis of factors influencing vaccination behavior. however, a limitation is the absence of cognitive factors, such as knowledge and attitudes, which could further explain vaccine hesitancy. additionally, as the covid-19 pandemic evolves and more information becomes available, public perceptions of vaccines may change, which this study could not account for. future research should include longitudinal data to capture these shifts.4.2. implications for policy and practicethe findings from this study highlight several areas for future action. first, psychological concerns and barriers to healthcare access must be addressed through targeted intervention strategies, particularly for economically vulnerable populations. educational campaigns should focus on debunking myths about vaccines and promoting the benefits of vaccination, particularly among those with higher education and those who engage in unhealthy behaviors like smoking. public health strategies should also integrate tailored support for individuals with poor mental health and unmet healthcare needs, which could improve overall vaccination rates. sthis study identified key determinants of covid-19 vaccination among korean adults using the andersen model. gender, age, education level, job status, marital status, psychological concerns about covid-19, healthcare access, unmet healthcare needs, mental health conditions, and health behaviors all significantly shaped vaccination patterns. the findings suggest that public health authorities should focus on disseminating reliable information about vaccines, especially to economically disadvantaged individuals and those with poor mental or physical health. tailored intervention strategies are necessary to actively promote vaccination uptake, particularly among socially vulnerable groups. in future research, longitudinal studies will be essential to monitor changes in vaccine perceptions and behaviors as the pandemic and vaccination campaigns evolve. overall, this study contributes to the growing body of knowledge on covid-19 vaccination and provides a solid foundation for designing educational and policy interventions to increase vaccination rates.'"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":39},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This configuration will result in repeating sentences.\ngeneration_kwargs = {\n

['for this reason, it is hypothesized that psu will correlate with different personality traits and psychopathological symptoms in digital immigrants (persons over 40 years of age) than in digital natives (persons under 40 years of age) (h4).in addition, digital natives can be divided into generations y and z. these, in turn, differ significantly in their lifestyles and the development tasks they have to master, and as echeburúa and de corral were able to determine, younger people are more inclined to form psu.. the relationship between personality and psu has already been widely researched to determine whether specific personality traits exist that predispose smartphone users to adopt addictive tendencies or problematic usage patterns.. for this reason, the hypothesis is proposed that psu correlates with different personality traits and psychopathological symptoms in members of generation y (persons over 25 years of age) than in members of generation z (persons under 25 years of age) (h5).. accordingly, it is easier for them to lose themselves in the endless possibilities of the smartphone and to tend toward psu.looking at the moderation, it becomes apparent that the generational groups moderate the effect of psychopathological symptoms of eating disorders on psu.. one possible reason could be that digital immigrants with eating disorder symptoms are more likely to withdraw and, in line with the pathway model, more likely to use the smartphone.looking at the moderation, it becomes apparent that the generational groups moderate the effect of psychopathological symptoms of depression on psu.. belonging to generation y or generation z moderates the influence of conscientiousness and depression on psu (h5).. one possible reason for this could be that generation y tends to withdraw, while generation z, in line with the pathway model, tends to seek reassurance from their smartphones.another moderation result is that generational groups are found to moderate the effect of the personality trait conscientiousness on psu.. it has been consistently found that psu is associated with high levels of the dimensions of neuroticism and extraversion.. most studies focus on adolescents and young adults who belong to the generation of digital natives when investigating psu.. the moderation analysis was run to determine whether the interaction between generation and psychopathological symptoms and personality traits predicts psu.. the moderation analysis was run to determine whether the interaction between generation and psychopathological symptoms and personality traits predicts psu.. therefore, we assume that there are also differences between generation y and generation z in the expression of psu (h2).consistent with previous research, personality traits and psychopathological symptoms should have an impact on psu; therefore, we hypothesize that psu correlates with personality and the presence of psychopathological symptoms (h3).. while generation z individuals with depressive symptoms tend to have more severe psu, the reverse is true for generation y individuals.. the results confirm that there are statistically significant differences between digital immigrants and digital natives in the expression of psu (h1)t(398) = 7.854,p< 0.001,d= 1.381, the personality traits neuroticismt(397) =

analysis was again calculated for the two generations y (persons over 25 years) and z (persons under 25 years).. although the similarity of symptoms does not entirely meet the necessary criteria of addiction, studies showed that psu could have negative impacts on fatigue, insomnia, diminished immune system, wrist syndrome, neck muscle fatigue, social isolation, family problems, neglect of daily chores, cyberbullying, sexual assault, and school failure.when considering psu, it is crucial to take a more nuanced look at the smartphone because it is not the technological device itself that is addictive, but the range of uses that the smartphone offers, which serve to satisfy needs and which, if misused, make it a space for multiple dependencies.. for this reason, the subgroups of digital natives, generation y and generation z, will be looked at more closely with regard to psu, as these generations are each going through different developmental tasks.. personality and psuthe increase in general psychological distress and the increase in smartphone use can be related and analyzed in the context of personality.. the big five personality traitshave been examined in many studies on psu.. the psychopathological symptoms for eating disorders, anxiety, and somatization, as well as the personality traits extraversion, neuroticism, openness, and agreeableness, could not explain any incremental variance and were therefore not included further.table 3.predictors of psu.total sample (n= 398)ßtpr2adjusted

significant predictors explained 30% of the variance in psu (f(11,385) = 15.264,p< 0.001,r2= 0.304), which corresponds to a high variance explanation (ibid.. thus, beyond the existing research, the article offers a significant contribution to the explanation of predictors of problematic smartphone use.1.6.. while digital immigrants believe that psu arises due to a lack of control by the individual user and is thus due to intrinsic characteristics, digital natives see the smartphone as the main communication tool at the center of their lives and therefore see psu as an unavoidable evil that has arisen extrinsically due to the environment created by the smartphone (ibid).in addition to exploring digital natives and digital immigrants, it is also necessary to look at the subgroups within digital natives, more specifically, generations y and z. depending on the definition, generation y includes those born between 1980 and 1996, while generation z includes those born between 1997 and 2010. while generation y, which is now 25 and older, is starting a more settled life due to age with more constant living circumstances such as a steady job, a long steady relationship, and slowly making fewer new friends, generation z is currently in early adolescence to young adulthood and has essential developmental steps to complete towards an independent life.. generational cohorts can make visible how specific formative experiences (changes regarding the world, economical, technological, and social changes) affect the lives and views of individuals.therefore, the article shows the factors influencing personality and psychopathology on problematic smartphone use.. and psychopathological symptomsmental health, in particular, plays a significant role when considering psu.. due to these correlations, a greater understanding of the reasons for maladaptive and problematic smartphone usage is required to prevent psychological health issues.',\n  'the results intable 2indicate that, overall, 15 variables had a statistically significant association with likely gad, including age, educational levels, relationship status, employment

anxiety disorder (gad) and likely major depressive disorder (mdd) among subscribers of the moregooddays program.. the results suggest that moregooddays participants who had received mental health counselling in the past were 18.5 times more likely to experience mdd symptoms compared with those who had not (or = 18.5; 95% ci: 1.55–200.00).. our findings add to the existing literature, suggesting that anxiety and depression are prevalent among adolescents and young adults and confirm the impact of the pandemic on this cohort.. during the covid-19 pandemic, one-fifth of young adults and a third of adolescents had mental health issues, including depression and generalized anxiety disorder.. univariate analysistable 4shows the results of the chi-square test of the association between demographic, clinical, and mental health characteristics and likely mdd.table 4below indicates that, overall, 16 variables had a statistically significant association in chi-square/fisher’s exact test (p< 0.05) or near significant (0.1 ≥p≥ 0.05) with likely mdd, including age, educational level, relationship status, employment status, housing status, ace score, mental health history of depression, anxiety, sud, adhd, no mental health history, on antidepressants, on sleeping tablets, on no psychotropic medication, and those who have received mental health counselling or desire to receive mental health counselling.. other studies proposed that the desire for mental health counseling may offer better insight into possible mental distress than individual clinical variables, necessitating the importance of providing prompt online psychological counseling services during the pandemic.finally, this study found that participants who had received mental health counseling in the past year were 18.5 times more likely to experience mdd symptoms than those who had not.. similarly, other studies during the pandemic reported a higher prevalence of anxiety, such as 60.8% among health science studentsand 66.86% among other respondents.the overall prevalence of likely mdd in our respondents was 56%, with a prevalence of 69.6% among participants aged 26 years or younger.. our study demonstrates that the desire for mental health counseling is the only variable that independently predicts likely gad among subscribers of the moregooddays program.. participants who expressed a desire for mental health counseling were 27 times more likely to experience gad symptoms than those who did not.. the model explained 35.8% (cox and snell r2) to 48.1% (nagelkerke r2) of the variance and correctly classified 79.3% of cases.table 3shows that only one variable, “would you like to receive mental health counselling?” independently predicted the likely presence of gad in the moregooddays participants.. for instance, a study among young adults before the covid-19 pandemic recorded a prevalence of (65%) for depression.. after controlling for all other variables in the regression model, participants who would like to receive mental health counselling were 27 times more likely to experience gad symptoms than those who did not (or = 27; 95% ci: 3.09–250.00).. the prevalence of anxiety in our study is comparable to prevalence estimates reported in other studies conducted during the pandemic.. we assessed likely generalized anxiety disorder (gad) and likely major depressive disorder (mdd) among moregooddays subscribers using the generalized anxiety disorder-7 (gad-7) scaleand the patient health questionnaire-9 (phq-9), respectively.. despite these limitations, our study provides valuable information about the prevalence of anxiety and depression during the covid-19 pandemic and highlights the long-term impact on adolescents and young adults.. similarly, moregooddays participants who would like to receive mental health counselling were 40 times more likely to experience mdd than those who did not (or = 40.03; 95% ci: 4.43–361.51).. in contrast to these reports, our study found that a history of mental health conditions, including anxiety and depression, did not independently predict the presence of likely gad or mdd in subscribers of moregooddays.adverse childhood experiences have long been linked to various mental health issues and may have a lifelong effect on an individual’s mental and physical health.. again, moregooddays participants who were undecided or unsure if they would like to receive mental health counselling were 29 times more likely to experience mdd than those who did not (or = 28.86; 95% ci: 3.07–271.45).. the imposed behavioural changes during the covid-19 pandemic may have also contributed to the increased number of adolescents and young adults with likely anxiety and likely depressive symptoms and other disorders at levels that require treatment.. our study aimed to assess the prevalence and predictors of likely generalized anxiety disorder (gad) and major depressive disorder (mdd) among subscribers of moregooddays, a daily supportive text message program co-created with adolescents and young adults for their peers.. the model explained 45.7% (cox and snell r2) to 60.9% (nagelkerke r2) of the variance and correctly classified 82.9% of cases.table 5shows that two variables, “have received mental health counselling in the past” and “would like to receive mental health counselling?” independently predicted the likely presence of mdd in moregooddays subscribers.. this longitudinal study also found that depression diagnosis independently predicted the presence of likely gad and that the frequency of depressive episodes experienced by adolescents and young adults predicted later psychiatric outcomes, including anxiety and depression.'],\n 'Abstract_clean': ['the study investigates psychopathological symptoms and the big five personality traits as predictors of “problematic smartphone use” (psu) in different generational groups. the generational groups were selected to analyze whether the different life stages and developmental tasks that need to be completed have an impact on psu. the groups were divided into digital immigrants, digital natives, and generation y and z as subgroups of digital natives. a total of 399 subjects participated (312 women, 86 men, 1 diverse; mean age = 25.9; range 14–67; 44 digital immigrants, 355 digital natives, 35 generation y, and 320 generation z). they completed the icd-10 symptom rating (isr), the big five inventory-10 (bfi-10), and the mobile phone problematic use scale (mppus). the results show differences between digital immigrants and digital natives in the expression of psu, neuroticism, conscientiousness, depression, anxiety, and compulsivity. concerning generations y and z, differences were only found in the expression of the psu. regression revealed that symptoms for obsessive-compulsive disorders, depression, conscientiousness, and gender were significant predictors of psu. moderations have shown that being a digital immigrant/native moderates the impact of eating disorders on psu. belonging to generation y/z moderates the influence of conscientiousness and depression on psu. thus, it shows that in different generations, different factors seem to play a role in the development and maintenance of psu.',\n  'background: the covid-19 pandemic has increased psychological

= 18.52; 95% ci: 1.55–200.00). demographic variables, including age, education, employment, and relationship status, and clinical variables, such as history of anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, adhd, and adverse childhood experience, did not independently the predict presence of likely gad or mdd in subscribers of moregooddays. conclusion: the prevalence of anxiety and depression was relatively high among subscribers of moregooddays, indicating the long-term effect of the covid-19 pandemic. this finding has significant implications in the broader contextof mental health research and emphasizes the need for more research into innovative mental health support for this cohort. the desire to receive counselling was predictive of both anxiety and depression and is a positive sign of the openness of this cohort to receive psychological intervention. since this group is mostly adapted to mobile text technology, government agencies and policymakers should prioritize and implement readily accessible interventions such as supportive text messages to support their psychological well-being.'],\n '__index_level_0__': [1222,

this reason, it is hypothesized that psu will correlate with different personality traits and psychopathological symptoms in digital immigrants (persons over 40 years of age) than in digital natives (persons under 40 years of age) (h4).in addition, digital natives can be divided into generations y and z. these, in turn, differ significantly in their lifestyles and the development tasks they have to master, and as echebura and de corral were able to determine, younger people are more inclined to form psu.. the relationship between personality and psu has already been widely researched to determine whether specific personality traits exist that predispose smartphone users to adopt addictive tendencies or problematic usage patterns.. for this reason, the hypothesis is proposed that psu correlates with different personality traits and psychopathological symptoms in members of generation y (persons over 25 years of age) than in members of generation z (persons under 25 years of age) (h5).. accordingly, it is easier for them to lose themselves in the endless possibilities of the smartphone and to tend toward psu.looking at the moderation, it becomes apparent that the generational groups moderate the effect of psychopathological symptoms of eating disorders on psu.. one possible reason could be that digital immigrants with eating disorder symptoms are more likely to withdraw and, in line with the pathway model, more likely to use the smartphone.looking at the moderation, it becomes apparent that the generational groups moderate the effect of psychopathological symptoms of depression on psu.. belonging to generation y or generation z moderates the influence of conscientiousness and depression on psu (h5).. one possible reason for this could be that generation y tends to withdraw, while generation z, in line with the pathway model, tends to seek reassurance from their smartphones.another moderation result is that generational groups are found to moderate the effect of the personality trait conscientiousness on psu.. it has been consistently found that psu is associated with high levels of the dimensions of neuroticism and extraversion.. most studies focus on adolescents and young adults who belong to the generation of digital natives when investigating psu.. the moderation analysis was run to determine whether the interaction between generation and',\n

onset of covid-19 in january 2020 heralded an unparalleled global health crisis, leading to widespread fatalities and significant lifestyle changes. the virus’s highly contagious nature, coupled with the emergence of mutated strains, continues to pose concerns about sustained transmission and enduring societal impacts. despite global vaccination efforts, covid-19 remains a substantial challenge. vaccination is pivotal not only for preventing infection but also for reducing the severity and risk of death from the virus. while surpassing the world health organization’s vaccination target, there is an ongoing need to investigate factors influencing vaccination rates, particularly among the unvaccinated population. as new infectious diseases persist, research becomes crucial to enhance community vaccination rates.prior studies have applied andersen’s model to discern factors affecting vaccination intentions. the andersen model, designed to predict individual use of medical services, categorizes factors into predisposing, enabling, and need factors. predisposing factors encompass demographic and sociological characteristics, enabling factors to cover aspects influencing the ability to use medical services and need factors pertaining to physical and mental health challenges.in a study examining college students’ covid-19 vaccination intentions applying the andersen model, factors such as demographic characteristics, the influence of peers, psychological predispositions, the acquisition of covid-19 vaccine information, vaccine literacy, health status, and covid-19-related experiences were considered. psychological predisposition significantly influenced college students’ covid-19 vaccination intentions. international studies have indicated lower vaccination intentions among women, younger individuals, those with lower education, and individuals in non-medical majors and occupations. a prior investigation into factors influencing covid-19 vaccination status among the elderly in china revealed that women, unmarried individuals, urban residents, and those with chronic diseases are less likely to receive the covid-19 vaccine.despite numerous studies on covid-19 in korea focusing on epidemiology, vaccine effectiveness, and vaccination intentions for specific groups, there is a scarcity of research identifying factors related to the actual vaccination of the entire korean population. this study aims to fill this gap by applying the andersen model to national-scale survey data, seeking to uncover factors influencing covid-19 vaccination and contribute to the development of community programs aimed at improving vaccination rates. additionally, it is important to address factors such as concerns about side effects, confidence in vaccine effectiveness, influence from peers and family, and policies regarding free vaccine provision to ensure a comprehensive understanding of vaccination behaviors and hesitancy.anderson modelthe andersen model, widely used in healthcare access studies, was selected for this research because it offers a comprehensive framework for understanding the multi-dimensional factors that influence health behaviors, such as covid-19 vaccination. the model divides these factors into three categories: predisposing factors (e.g., demographic and psychological characteristics), enabling factors (e.g., resources or barriers to care), and need factors (e.g., health status and perceived need for care). these categories align well with the determinants explored in this study. previous research has demonstrated the andersen model’s effectiveness in examining vaccination behavior, particularly in understanding how individual characteristics, access to healthcare, and perceived needs influence vaccination decisions. by utilizing this model, we aim to identify the various factors that contribute to covid-19 vaccination uptake among korean adults. s2.1. data and samplethis study utilized primary data from the 2022 korea community health survey (kchs) conducted by the korea disease control and prevention agency between 16 august and 31 october 2022. the kchs is an annual cross-sectional survey that employs a multistage, stratified area probability sampling method to select participants from civilian, non-institutionalized korean households. sampling is based on geographic area, age, and sex, ensuring representative data across different demographic groups. data collection was performed through one-on-one in-person interviews using standardized questionnaires administered by trained surveyors.for the purposes of this study, participants who reported receiving a covid-19 vaccination were initially considered. however, individuals who reported being unvaccinated were excluded from the final analysis. after applying these exclusion criteria, a total of 231,784 individuals were retained in the final dataset.2.2. measurement2.2.1. predisposing factorpredisposing factors refer to the demographic and psychological characteristics of individuals that may influence health behavior. in this study, age was categorized into two groups: 19–64 and 65 or older. gender was classified as either male or female. job status was divided into those with an occupation and those without. spouse status was categorized based on whether participants had a spouse or not, including those who were never married, divorced, or widowed. education level was classified as either below high school graduate or college and above. lastly, psychological concerns related to covid-19 were measured by asking participants to rate their level of concern in three specific areas: (1) concern about infection, (2) concern about public criticism, and (3) concern about economic damage.in this study, psychological concerns related to covid-19, such as fear of infection and economic anxiety, were considered part of predisposing factors. this is in line with the andersen model, which allows for psychological characteristics to be included as individual-level factors influencing health behavior. although these factors could also be viewed sociologically, they are incorporated here as predisposing influences based on individual perceptions and experiences.2.2.2. enabling factorsenabling factors refer to conditions that either facilitate or hinder access to healthcare services. in this study, unmet healthcare needs were assessed by asking participants, “over the past year, have you ever felt that you could not or did not access medical services when needed?” responses were categorized as either “yes” or “no”. the status of being a recipient of the national basic livelihood guarantee, a form of government-provided social assistance, was also considered. additionally, region of residence was categorized based on participants’ living locations, grouped as either urban or rural areas.2.2.3. need factorsneed factors most directly reflect access to medical care by highlighting disease characteristics. in this study, subjective health, stress, depression, chronic diseases, current smoking, current alcohol drinking, and eating breakfast were included. subjective health was categorized as “very bad, bad, normal, good, and very good” and later reclassified as “above good” and “below normal”. depression was assessed using the patient health questionnaire-9 (phq-9), recommended with a cutoff score of 5(park et al., 2010). chronic diseases included diagnosed hypertension and diabetes. current smoking was determined by the question: “do you smoke now?” current alcohol drinking refers to those who consumed alcohol within the past month.2.statistical analyses were performed using ibm spss statistics v21.0 (ibm corp., armonk, ny, usa). categorical variables were presented as proportions and compared using chi-square tests to identify differences between groups. binary logistic regression was used as the outcome variable (vaccination status), which was dichotomous.both univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the factors associated with covid-19 vaccination. univariate logistic regression was first employed to assess the crude relationships between each independent variable and the dependent variable (covid-19 vaccination status). this step allowed us to identify the raw associations without adjusting for potential confounders.following the univariate analysis, multiple logistic regression was performed to adjust for confounding variables and determine the independent effects of each predictor on vaccination status. variables that were significant in the univariate analysis (p< 0.05) were included in the multivariate model. the results were presented as odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals. sthe outcomes presented intable 1illustrate an analysis of covid-19 vaccination patterns concerning predisposing, enabling, and need factors. among the participants, 3.4% reported being unvaccinated. the frequencies and percentage distributions of each categorical variable related to covid-19 vaccination were derived using the

in south korea using data from the 2022 korea community health survey (kchs). given that vaccination is one of the most cost-effective measures during public health crises, the andersen model was employed to provide a comprehensive framework for assessing the factors influencing vaccination decisions. the findings are consistent with previous studies while also revealing new insights into vaccination behavior in south korea.predisposing factors, such as age, gender, job status, marital status, education level, and psychological concerns about covid-19, significantly impact covid-19 vaccination. individuals over 65, females, those employed, and those with spouses exhibited a lower risk of being unvaccinated, aligning with previous findings. this trend could be attributed to the national vaccination program’s focus on individuals aged 65 and older, which successfully increased vaccination rates in this group. interestingly, individuals with higher education (college level and above) showed a greater risk of being unvaccinated. this result contradicts some prior findings, suggesting that more research is needed to explore the influence of education on vaccine hesitancy. psychological concerns related to covid-19 underscore the need for psychological support programs, considering the psychological impact on the vaccination group. in preparing covid-19 countermeasures, addressing psychological and social aspects, tailored to the varying levels of psychological concern, is imperative. effective intervention and support systems are vital as community residents’ psychological concerns can influence their health and behavior. tailored psychological support and information campaigns should address these concerns to improve vaccination rates.enabling factors like unmet healthcare needs and recipients of national basic livelihood guarantees were associated with higher risks of being unvaccinated. these findings underscore the necessity of targeted interventions for socially vulnerable populations, such as economically disadvantaged groups, who may face barriers to accessing healthcare. providing reliable information on the safety and efficacy of vaccines, coupled with support systems, could improve vaccination coverage in these communities. social distancing measures and the pandemic’s broader social impacts have further exacerbated the challenges for these populations.need factors, including subjective health, depression, current smoking, and skipping breakfast, were also associated with a higher risk of being unvaccinated. people reporting poor subjective health or depression often display vaccine hesitancy, necessitating motivational and educational programs. the association between smoking and vaccine distrust reflects the need for targeted interventions aimed at smokers, as smoking may contribute to vaccine hesitancy. skipping breakfast, often linked to poor nutrition, could impair immune functionand thus influence attitudes toward vaccination. interestingly, those with chronic diseases were less likely to be unvaccinated, suggesting that they understand the preventive benefits of vaccination, which is consistent with previous studies. however, the lower risk of being unvaccinated among current drinkers contradicted earlier research, highlighting the need for further investigation.4.1. strengths and limitationsthis study benefits from the use of a large, nationally representative dataset, enhancing the generalizability of its findings. the application of the andersen model also allows for a structured analysis of factors influencing vaccination behavior. however, a limitation is the absence of cognitive factors, such as knowledge and attitudes, which could further explain vaccine hesitancy. additionally, as the covid-19 pandemic evolves and more information becomes available, public perceptions of vaccines may change, which this study could not account for. future research should include longitudinal data to capture these shifts.4.2. implications for policy and practicethe findings from this study highlight several areas for future action. first, psychological concerns and barriers to healthcare access must be addressed through targeted intervention strategies, particularly for economically vulnerable populations. educational campaigns should focus on debunking myths about vaccines and promoting the benefits of vaccination, particularly among those with higher education and those who engage in unhealthy behaviors like smoking. public health strategies should also integrate tailored support for individuals with poor mental health and unmet healthcare needs, which could improve overall vaccination rates. sthis study identified key determinants of covid-19 vaccination among korean adults using the andersen model. gender, age, education level, job status, marital status, psychological concerns about covid-19, healthcare access, unmet healthcare needs, mental health conditions, and health behaviors all significantly shaped vaccination patterns. the findings suggest that public health authorities should focus on disseminating reliable information about vaccines, especially to economically disadvantaged individuals and those with poor mental or physical health. tailored intervention strategies are necessary to actively promote vaccination uptake, particularly among socially vulnerable groups. in future research, longitudinal studies will be essential to monitor changes in vaccine perceptions and behaviors as the pandemic and vaccination campaigns evolve. overall, this study contributes to the growing body of knowledge on covid-19 vaccination and provides a solid foundation for designing educational and policy interventions to increase vaccination rates.'"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":25},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This configuration will result in repeating sentences.\ngeneration_kwargs = {\n
